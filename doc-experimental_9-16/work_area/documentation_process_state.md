# Documentation Process State

**Process Reference:** Documentation Development Process (`doc-bot/doc-bot-process.md`)
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-16

## Current Project Context
- **Documentation Project:** nvFuser documentation development (doc-bot)
- **Project Goal:** Build implementation-ready documentation that captures implicit expert knowledge for nvFuser
- **Target Audience:** nvFuser contributors, framework engineers, and collaborating AI systems
- **SME Identified:** Project maintainer/user (nvFuser expert)

## Stage Progress
- **Current Stage:** Stage 1: Research and Information Gathering
- **Stage Status:** In Progress
- **Current Deliverable Focus:** Stage 1 information inventory and research log
- **Stage Completion Criteria:** All identified sources extracted; comprehensive domain coverage achieved

## Process State
- **SME Consultation Status:** needed (to confirm priority sources and clarify gaps)
- **Validation Checkpoint Status:** approaching (Primary at Stage 6; Final at Stage 9)
- **Fresh Perspective Review Status:** not yet scheduled
- **Technical Documentation Best Practices Application:** Implicit Knowledge Capture; Hierarchical Information Architecture; Clear Technical Communication; System Integration Understanding

## Immediate Actions
- **Next Action Required:** Expand `stage1_information_inventory.md` with additional sources and begin extraction of key documents and code hotspots
- **Approval Needed:** None (will request SME input if gaps/contradictions emerge)
- **Dependencies:** Access to repository files; SME availability for targeted clarifications
