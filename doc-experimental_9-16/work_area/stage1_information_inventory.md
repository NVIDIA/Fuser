# Stage 1: Information Inventory and Research Log (2025-09-16)

## Source Index (initial)
- **Process docs**
  - `doc-bot/doc-bot-process.md`
  - `doc-bot/Appendices/AI_Assisted_Development_Core_Principles.md`
  - `doc-bot/Appendices/Technical_Documentation_Best_Practices.md`
- **Repo code hotspots (starting points)**
  - `csrc/fusion.h`
  - `csrc/fusion_guard.h`
  - `csrc/dispatch.cpp`
  - `csrc/debug.cpp`
- **doc-bot workspace (selected)**
  - `doc-bot/experimenting/9-16/work_area/chat_log.md`
  - `doc-bot/summary_work/doc-experimental_9-10/index.md` (and linked topics)

## Extraction Queue
- [ ] Extract key concepts and workflows from `doc-bot/doc-bot-process.md` (done at high level; verify any gaps)
- [ ] Skim appendices for cross-reference principles to apply during Stage 2
- [ ] Identify nvFuser orchestration entry points in `csrc/fusion.h` and related files
- [ ] Collect debug/inspection flows from `csrc/debug.cpp` for verifiable examples
- [ ] Map summary topics from `summary_work/doc-experimental_9-10/index.md` for later content mapping

## Research Log (timestamped)
- 2025-09-16: Initialized inventory; identified initial docs and code hotspots

## Open Questions for SME
- Which nvFuser areas should be prioritized first (IR anatomy, scheduling, runtime, or Python front-end)?
- Any canonical external references to include (papers, design docs)?

## Notes
- Focus on implicit knowledge capture: design rationale, orchestration flows, temporal/historical context, and performance considerations.
- Keep information hierarchical for later structure development.
