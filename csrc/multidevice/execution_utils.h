// Given a TensorView and the shape of a sharded tensor of which certain
// dimensions are partially allocated, returns the global shape that'll be used
// to bind to the TensorView's logical domain. This is to solve #3282 so we can
// bind a sharded tensor to a TensorView that has a DID-parallel loop domain.
//
// For example, when `tv` is
//   logical: iM, iN
//   allocation: iDIDx{D}, iN/D, iM
// and `sizes` is [2, 3], the returned shape will be [2, 3D]. This is because,
// according to the allocation domain, iM is fully allocated and iN is sharded
// and thus partially allocated.
//
// If the TensorView is not sharded, this function returns `sizes`.
//
// Limitations:
// - The function assumes that there are no Merges from logical to the
// DID-parallel IterDomains in allocation. Otherwise, it's unclear which logical
// dimension this DID-parallelization should be attributed to.
// - The function assumes that all Splits from logical to the DID-parallel
// IterDomains in allocation are even. This is because there are currently no
// ways to pass in the global shape.
//
// Despite these limitations, this approach was taken as a shortcut to fix
// #3282. Some alternatives considered in #3282 are:
// - Try to bind `at::Tensor`s to allocation domains instead of logical. Many
// `*Op::evaluate` methods (e.g.
// https://github.com/NVIDIA/Fuser/blob/2415d904d1e9a5da7ca6fb1a55d3045bbd510341/csrc/ir/nodes.cpp#L4321-L4329)
// assume the input/output `at::Tensor`s have the same dimension order as the
// logical domain. Doing so would have to change them all.
// - Try to pass into FusionExecutorCache both logical (global) shapes and
// allocated (local) tensors for sharded TensorViews. The logical shapes would
// have to be passed through FusionKernelRuntime, FusionExecutor,
// ExpressionEvaluator, and so on, which is an API overhaul.
