//
// t0: [i0, i1]
// t1 = broadcast(t0) // [i0, b2, i1]
// t2 = expand(t1, {-1, 2, -1}); // [i0, b2(2), i1]
// t3 = reshape(t2, {i0, 2 * i1}); // [i0, 2*i1]
//
// It is especially important to recognize this pattern when it
// appears at the end of a pointwise fusion segment, where an output
// is used as the reference tensor of scheduling the segment. For
// example, if a segment has the above pattern at the end of
// the segment with t3 as the only output, the whole segment may be
// scheduled based on t3. That is quite common in RoPE, where Q, K and
// V tensors have different sizes but smaller tensors are commonly
// repeated at the end of its computation.
//
// This can be problematic since the whole segment is scheduled based
// on the repeated tensor whose size is larger than the rest of the
// tensors by the repetition factor. For example, if the it is
// repeated twice, we would launch threads and blocks that are
// required for the twice-larger tensor but most of the actual
// computations will actually only need half of them. In fact,
// depending on actual scheduling strategies, they may be just
// redundantly doing the same computations, which should be avoided if
// possible.
//
// getMaybeStaticRepeatInfo analyzes a given tensor and its producers
// to detect the above repeat pattern. The detected pattern is
// currently only used by the resize scheduler. It effectively factors
// out the repetition factor as an iter domain and moves it to the
// outermost position. The remaining iter domains are scheduled and
// propagated to the rest of the tensors.
//
// TODO: Consider generalizing this heuristics to the other
// schedulers.

// Some of the relevant iter domains of the output tensor of the
