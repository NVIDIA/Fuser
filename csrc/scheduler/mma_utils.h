//! [WarpMmaSwizzler]:
//!   This class is used to implement the thread swizzle format
//!     required for the mma macros, cf. PTX ISA 9.7.13.4.
//!
//!   The mma instructions (Volta through Ampere) require specific
//!     thread mapping within a warp for both the mma inputs and
//!     mma outputs. All mma swizzle patterns seen so far turned out
//!     to be affine, so we could use the normal scheduler interface
//!     to fulfill the mma thread swizzle pattern. And fusion with
//!     other non-mma ops and validations can just natually rely on the current
//!     iterdomain infrastructure.
//!
//!   This is different from a normal scheduler utility though,
//!      as the thread mapping within a warp are *required* to be
//!      a specific pattern which currently translates to an enforced
//!      requirement that all the leaf domains produced by WarpMmaSwizzler
//!      cannot be further transformed (split/merge/reorder etc.).
//!
//!   Currently WarpMmaSwizzler can be accessed by schedulers through
//!     TensorView::applyMmaSwizzle, and the current scheduling procedure is
//!     as follows:
//!
//!   Step 1. Before scheduling, the mma op needs to be configured with a macro
//!   type, either manually or inferred (eg. Volta_16_16_4).
//!
//!   Step 2. Scheduler can tile the outer dimensions based on any heuristics,
//!   i.e. the CTA tiling, warp tiling, splitK etc.
//!
//!   Step 3. The scheduler will need to split the innermost part of the 3
//!   involved
//!    root dimensions, they need to be ordered as M,N,K on the rightmost of
//!    tensordomain (see [Operand Layout Convention] for exact definition).
//!
//!    For example before calling WarpMmaSwizzler, the domain could look like:
//!    [TileM, TileN, TileK, Im(16), In(16), Rk(4)], to use Volta_16_16_4.
//!    The rightmost 3 iterdomains need to be the innermost component of their
//!    corresponding root id, similar to vectorization except this requirement
//!    applies to all 3 rightmost dims.
//!
//!         Before applying swizzle, WarpMmaSwizzler will try to validate:
//!           1. The "innermost-ness" of the rightmost 3 iterdomains. E.g:
//!              Xo, Xi = split(X, 16),
//!               Xo doesn't check, Xi would check.
//!           2. The rightmost three are constant sized, and they are ordered as
//!           M,N,K.
//!             In the case of operand schedule before the broadcast, only 2 of
//!             the axis are see, and they still need to follow the same order,
//!             i.e. need to be M,K or N,K.
//!           3. The rightmost three axes have matching size with the selected
//!           mma macro.
//!
//!    Step 4. WarpMmaSwizzler will transform the rightmost 3 domains to the
//!    correct swizzle
//!     format and will parallelize the TIDx, which is reserved for lane id. The
//!     transformed inner iterdomains will be locked with WarpMapped tag so that
//!     they cannot be further transformed. Currently the only change that
//!     scheduler can still do after this step is to vectorize the innermost
//!     iterdomain.
//!
//! Notes:
//!   This version of implementation is trying to balance the composition
//!   flexibility and validation complexity. Currently the validation protocol
//!   is that if the rightmost 3 dimensions given to WarpMmaSwizzler are indeed
//!   innermost components of the 3 root id's and their dimensions match the mma
//!   macro, the swizzle format produced by WarpMmaSwizzler will be correct for
//!   the macro and we just lock the innermost iterdomains from further
//!   transformations.
//!
//!   Ninja users/schedulers might go for 2 cases that we currently don't
//!   support:
//!
//!   1. Equivalent affine transforms:
//!     Even though the mma swizzles are affine, there are still infinitely many
//!     equivalent ways to implement
//!      the same affine transform. E.g. io,ii = split(i,8); ioii =
//!      merge(io,ii); would make ioii equiv to i if it's a divisible split. One
//!      can use this to construct infinite many equivalent affine swizzles.
//!
//!     Users/schedulers might want to have a different but equivalent affine
//!     representation from the one provided
//!      by WarpMmaSwizzler, but validating them needs some extra work
//!      canonicalizing the affine transforms. So short term wouldn't support
//!      this flexibility.
//!
//!   2. Swizzled data input:
//!     It is also possible that the data input has other swizzles before
//!     entering the fusion already and some might be natively compatible
//!     with mma format. This is a very broad category of use cases
//!     and we'd have to consider enabling any use like this case-by-case.
