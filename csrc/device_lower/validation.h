//!   - Currently only allow swizzle ops on the right of CA axis,

//!   - Xor and Transpose swizzle have to have equal dimensions on the
//!       participating ids.

//! Validate use of ParallelType::Group. It is currently only allowed
//! in ReductionOp and not in WelfordOp. Group has similar constraints
//! as Vectorize, e.g., it can only be used with IterDomains with
//! static extents. Differences are, e.g, it has no constraints on
//! alignments and predicates. Each individual reduction has its own
//! predicate, so it is possile for only part of grouped reductions to
//! be executed.
//!
//! Also, grouping is only enabled for persistent grid reductions, in
//! other words, grid allreduces. Note that no grid reduction without
//! broadcast is persistent anymore.
//!
//! Validated ReductionOp with ParallelType::Group is converted to
//! GroupedReductionOp.
