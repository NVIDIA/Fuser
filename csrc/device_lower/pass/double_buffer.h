// Double buffering a tensor doubles its allocation size and uses two
// buffers to facilitate computation and memory access
// overlapping. The basic form of code looks like as follows:
//
// Before:
// for i
//   x[S]; // allocation
//   for j:
//     x[j] = y[i, j]
//   for j:
//     ... = x[j]
//
// After:
// X[S * 2]; // allocation
// for i in 0 to 1: // Prologue
//   for j:
//     x[j] = y[i, j]
//
// for i in 0 to N-1: // Main
//   for j:
//     x[j + (1 - i % 2) * S] = y[i + 1, j]
//   for j:
//     ... = x[j + (i % 2) * S]
//
// for i in N-1 to N: // Epilogue
//   for j:
//     ... = x[j + (i % 2) * S]
//
// Here, S is the original size of tensor x.
//
// The i loop is the double buffer loop of tensor x, where double
// buffering is applied to the tensor. The first step of lowering is
// to find the double buffering axis for each double buffered
// tensor. It must not be parallelized as it isn't possible to double
// buffer parallelized loops. Also, an unrolled axis expands the
// allocation and is intended to make the loop completely unrolled,
// which also conflicts with double buffering. So, basically, the double
// buffering axis is the inner-most axis within the axes left
// of the CA position. However, when it is parallelized or unrolled, a
// further left axis is picked.
//
// Once the double buffer axis is determined, the main task is to
// replicate the corresponding double buffer loop as illustrated
// above. The Prologue loop is to just fetch the first element to
// populate the buffer. The main loop is mostly the same as the
// original loop, except for the indexing change to switch the two
// buffers. When used as a consumer, an offset of (1 - i % 2) * S is
// added, whereas (i % 2) * S is added when used as a producer. Here,
// i is the index of the double buffer loop. The Epilogue loop is just
// for the last iteration of the loop. Since the main loop reads one
// element ahead of the producer of the double buffered tensor, it
// would require an additional guard to prevent buffer overruns with
// the producer if the main loop were also used for the last
// iteration. However, the value loaded by the invalid load would not
// be used, so instead of adding the additional predicate, the Epilogue
// loop is replicated from the original loop, except for the load
// expression since it's not used. Note that this overrun does not
// happen when the producer is on gmem, so in that case, this
// additional replication is not done.
//
// When creating those three types of loops, additional care must be
// taken when multiple tensors are double buffered. When multiple
// tensors use the same loop as their double buffer loop, one pass of
// replication takes care of them at once, meaning the same Prologue,
// Main, Epilogue loops are used for the multiple tensors.
//
// Other tasks to do for a double buffer tensor include:
// - Move allocation to outside of the double buffer loop
// - Double the allocation size
// - Omit the RAW sync in the Main and Epilogue loops

// [Cicular buffer] An generalization of double buffering.
// On sm80+ hardware there is asynchronous copy infrastructure that
//  motivates a circular buffering generalization of double buffering.
// Almost all analyses previously done for double buffering are exactly
//  the same with circular buffering, except for the introduction of
//  new concept: `stage depth`.
//
// The `stage depth` is defined as the multiplier of extra buffering
//  space used. In the case of double buffering, the stage depth would
//  be 2.
//
// A circular buffered loop structure would look like follows, which
//  exactly parallels the case of double buffered loop structure, since
//  it is a exact generalization to the same purpose.
//
// Here S is the original allocation size as above,
//  D is the stage depth. With D=2, the below loop structure becomes
//  exactly the same as the case in double buffering.
//
// allocate X[S*D] // allocation
// for i in 0..D-1: // prolog
//   for j in ...
//     if pred:
//       x[i*S+j] = y[i, j];
//
// for i in 0..N: // main loop
//   for j in ...
//     if pred:
//       x[((i+D-1)%D)*S+j] = y[i+D-1, j];
//   for j in ...
//     .. = x[(i%D)*S+j]
//
// (Epilog omitted since this only makes sense in using
// cp.async, where producer will be in global mem and consumer will
// be in shared mem).
//
// The profitability of this optimization comes from extra tolerance
//  of global memory pipeline latency, as on the expression `.. = x[(i%D)*S+j]`
//  we only need to make sure the data for the current iteration is
//  completed while the remaining D-2 load iterations could still be in progress
//  and overlap with the computes of the current loop.
//
// To express this pattern on sm80+ hardware we can group the loads
//  in each iteration of the circular buffered loop as one "transaction",
//  and specify how many transactions we want to ensure completion when
//  we insert the async barriers.
//
// allocate X[S*D] // allocation
// for i in 0..D-1: // prolog
//   for j in ...
//     if pred:
//       x[i*S+j] = y[i, j];
//   cp.async.commit; // mark the transaction boundary
//
// # At this point we have D-1 transactions on the fly.
//   and for the first iteration of the main loop we need
//   one transaction completed, so we leave D-2 transactions
//   on the fly, which would be the input to the barrier instruction.
//
// cp.async.wait D-2 // ensure all but the last D-2 transactions complete.
//
// for i in 0..N: // main loop
//   # At this point we always have D-2 transactions on the fly.
//      and one completed.
//   for j in ...
//     if pred:
//       x[((i+D-1)%D)*S+j] = y[i+D-1, j];
//   for j in ...
//     .. = x[(i%D)*S+j]
//   cp.async.commit; // mark the transaction boundary for the
//                       load issued in this iteration.
//   # At this point we have D-1 transactions on the fly,
//       and none completed.
//   cp.async.wait D-2; // Ensure all but the last D-2 transactions complete.
//   __syncthreads(); // Need to syncthreads because each thread will only
//                      ensure completion of its own async copies so
//                      would need to sync to this point to ensure
//                      completion of the whole tile.
