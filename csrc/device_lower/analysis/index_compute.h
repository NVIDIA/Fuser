//! getTensorIndexFromIdGraph is the function that index_compute will call very
//! straightforwardly. However, for implementing the new indexing logic that
//! starts to abstract some of the indexing away from index_compute we need to
//! move quite a bit of the intertwined indexing logic away from the
//! index_compute file and the index_reference_replay file. This is because we
//! want to separate out what has to be done on the fly, from what analysis we
//! can do early on with the iter domain graph and associated properties.
//!
//! getTensorIndexFromIdGraph places this analysis internally in
//! LoopIndexingAnalysis. LoopIndexingAnalysis though has to communicate to:
//!   1) index_compute.cpp::IndexCompute to tell IndexCompute which expressions
//!   it needs to traverse to compute the indexing math.
//!   2) lower_shift.cpp::HaloInfo::buildConcreteHaloExtentMap to build the halo
//!   extent map used in indexing.
//!
//! LoopIndexing is nothing but a mechanism for this communication.
//!
//! Holds information needed to produce indexing math. In the current version of
//! indexing pass, the iter domains combined with the loop nests are the source
//! of truth in terms of resolving the actual integer indexing math from the
//! sequence of iterdomain transforms.
//!
//! This information is crtiical in resolving indexing associated with complex
//! broadcast patterns. Check FusionComplexBCast* test cases as well as
//! Indexing* tests for examples where resolving indices from IterDomain
//! transformations can be challenging.
//!
//! The source of this challenge is due to inling patterns where the IterDomains
//! responsible for control flow are not local to a particular TensorView.
//! Broadcast, operations like view/reshape, and gather/shift can make indexing
//! local buffers complex because of the complex effects inlining into other
//! TensorViews produce.
//!
//! TODO:
//!   The first iteration tries to match the semantics of reference
//!     replay without any new logic. In a follow up iteration will
//!     need to revisit a few further pathological patterns.
//!
//! Note:
//!   The current implementation of loop indexing pass works on
//! equivalent classes defined by ComputeAt exact map. The
//! list of expressions stored in this class form a "reference", graph of
//! iterdomain expressions when all of their inputs and outputs are replaced
//! with their exact concrete mapped id's.
//!
//!   Here an invariant in a graph of iterdomain expressions is that
//! each iterdomain is produced exactly once and is either a leaf domain
//! or has been consumed exactly once by another expression. This makes sure
//! that a well defined indexing can be generated for each of the concrete ids
//! whenever we either forward or backward traverse the graph.
