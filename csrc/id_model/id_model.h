// A collection of ValGraphs that are built from a fusion or series of

//
// EXACT/PERMISSIVE mode:
//
// consumer[i0, b1] = producer[i0]
// consumer->merge(0) (consumer will now be [i0 * b1])
//
// When producer is replayed as consumer (the direction we use for mapping)
// with forwarding from ForwardingInfo the producer to consumer map will have
// both a mapping of consumer(i0) to producer(i0) as well as consumer(i0*b1) to
// producer(i0). This latter mapping is important for loop nest mappings as the
// consumer will generate a loop based on i0*b1 and the producer may be
// computeAt inside this loop nest. However, for indexing we do not want these
// two iter domains mapped as producer may be indexed as i0*i1 depending on the
// loop nest structure and how it was built.
//
// Exact mode is if the iter domain relationships from producer to consumer are
// considered the exact same size operating on matching dimensions from the root
// domain mapping.
//
// IdMappingMode::EXACT
//   Don't map any broadcast axes to non-broadcast axes
//   Do not forward through any broadcast IDs
