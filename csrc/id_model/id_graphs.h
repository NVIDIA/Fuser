// A collection of IterDomainGraphs that are built from a fusion or series of
// expressions. These graphs are related, but have some distinct features based
// on the IdMappingMode.
//
// EXACT/PERMISSIVE mode:
//
// consumer[i0, b1] = producer[i0]
// consumer->merge(0) (consumer will now be [i0 * b1])
//
// When producer is replayed as consumer (the direction we use for mapping)
// with forwarding from ForwardingInfo the producer to consumer map will have
// both a mapping of consumer(i0) to producer(i0) as well as consumer(i0*b1) to
// producer(i0). This latter mapping is important for loop nest mappings as the
// consumer will generate a loop based on i0*b1 and the producer may be
// computeAt inside this loop nest. However, for indexing we do not want these
// two iter domains mapped as producer may be indexed as i0*i1 depending on the
// loop nest structure and how it was built.
//
// Exact mode is if the iter domain relationships from producer to consumer are
// considered the exact same size operating on matching dimensions from the root
// domain mapping.
//
// LOOP mode is important to resolve inlined broadcassts. If we have something
// like: consumer[i0o, threadIdx.x{i0i}] = producer[i0o,
// threadIdx.y{i0i}](computeAt = 1) which can easily happen when using shared
// memory. Loop is actually defined for all iteration domains, and resembles
// groups of iter domains that are effectively inlined with eachother. Therefore
// iter domain's that are a common dependency of inlined leaf domains may be
// loop mapped together. This map is developed in lowering from
// bulidInlinePromotions and buildLoopPromotionMap.
//
// Loop promotion is a mechanism by which to capture inlined resolved
// broadcasts. If a consumer resolves a broadcast of a producer, and the
// producer's broadcast is inlined (in total or partially). Then the producer's
// iter domain will be "promoted" to the size of the consumers iter domain.
//
// IdMappingMode::LOOP
//   Forward broadcast axes in replay
//   Denotes groups of IterDomains that are considered promoted to a common iter
//   domain size
// IdMappingMode::PERMISSIVE
//   Forward broadcast axes in replay
//   Map all iteration domains
//   Always contain root mappings (otherwise they could have been forwarded in
//   broadcast)
// IdMappingMode::EXACT
//   Don't map any broadcast axes to non-broadcast axes
//   Do not forward through any broadcast IDs
// IdMappingMode::AlmostExact
//   Forward through broadcast axes, but not through to a non-broadcast axis
//     i.e. id{b1*i0}, id{i0} are mapped
//          id{i1*i0}, id{i0} are not mapped (this part is the difference from
//          PERMISSIVE)
//   Forward through split one axes, i.e. id{ceilDiv(i0, 1)}, id{i0} are mapped
//
