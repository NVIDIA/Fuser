  // Validate a given exact graph of IdModel by comparing it with
  // ComputeAtMap. Their maps should
  // be almost the same but there are some differences.
  // - In ComputeAtMap, swizzles are just skipped no matter what swizzle
  // type is used, so only swizzle outputs are mapped. In IdModel,
  // only swizzle inputs are mapped, except for Loop swizzles where
  // their inputs and outputs are mapped.
  // - In ComputeAtMap, mappings are local. For example, if domain x0 is
  // split to x1 and x2, and also domain y0 is split to y1 and
  // y2. Suppose x0 and y0 are exactly mapped and the two splits are
  // also considered exactly the same, IdModel maps x1 and y1, and x2
  // and y2, respectively, whereas that doesn't happen with ComputeAtMap
  //
  // Accounting for the first difference doesn't seem trivial, so when
  // swizzle is used we give up validating the exact graph. The second
  // difference is whether mappings are propagated, which can be
  // accounted for by updating the ComputeAtMap as is done in IdModel.
