//! [ Note -- Post-definition cache implementation ]
//!
//! First note that depending on how we acquire a computational graph, there may
//! be additional levels of caching above those discussed in this note. For
//! example, our Python frontend contains a cache of defined Fusions in order to
//! speed up acquisition of a Fusion object in its designed use cases. In this
//! note, we will discuss caching that occurs below the definition level,
//! assuming there is another mechanism that builds a Fusion object and passes
//! it to us.
//!
//! The primary interface to post-definition caching is the
//! `FusionExecutorCache`. This class holds an unsegmented, unscheduled Fusion
//! object that might contain symbolic operations. This Fusion is then evaluated
//! using `FusionExecutorCache::runFusionWithInputs` to produce outputs in the
//! form of ATen Tensors.
//!
//! FusionKernelRuntime is responsible for segmentation and execution of a
//! single concretized Fusion object with a given set of inputs. Each
//! FusionKernelRuntime is valid only for a given concrete Fusion and applies
//! only to a range of input properties. If the properties of some inputs
//! change, we can check if a Fusion can be used with the new inputs, but if not
//! then a new FusionKernelRuntime would need to be created, which means a whole
//! new segmentation run. No additional caching is performed beneath the
//! FusionKernelRuntime level, so caching is implemented in
//! FusionExecutorCache::getKernelRuntimeFor to reduce the latency in mapping
//! from a set of inputs to a valid FusionKernelRuntime object.
//!
//! The content of input tensors does not affect the structure of the Fusion
//! graph or the validity of compiled CUDA kernels. However, the following other
//! properties might: rank, DataType, contiguity, stride order, size (whether a
//! dimension has size=1). When all of these properties are repeated, there is
//! an opportunity to reduce the latency of producing a compiled Fusion and
//! launch params (a KernelExecutor). Given inputs, we first compute an ID using
//! InputsIdLookup::lookupId that encodes tensor properties along with values of
//! any integer-valued input scalars that might affect concretization. This ID
//! is guaranteed not to conflict unless the inputs can be executed by the same
//! compiled Fusion. It is mapped to a segmented and compiled
//! FusionKernelRuntime that can be immediately run. This is the most common,
//! lowest-latency path and is followed when the Fusion is repeatedly evaluated
//! with inputs that differ only in their tensor values.
//!
//! When there is no FusionKernelRuntime matching the given input ID, we first
//! map the inputs to a concrete Fusion. For static Fusions this is trivial,
//! but when the Fusion is dynamic it means we must use the inputs to
//! "concretize" the Fusion by performing replacements such that the Fusion no
//! longer contains Symbolic IterDomains. A static Fusion is considered to be
//! already concretized. As discussed above, each concretized Fusion might have
//! multiple FusionKernelRuntimes applying to different ranges of inputs.
//! In the second layer of post-definition caching, we map concretized Fusions
//! (in the form of a DynamicTransformConcretizationInfo object) to a vector of
//! FusionKernelRuntimes, and check whether each one is able to run the present
//! inputs. If not, we create a new FusionKernelRuntime for those inputs and
//! record it in the list (as well as recording a mapping from the input ID to
//! the new runtime).
//!
//! In the case of a dynamic Fusion, input scalars such as integer parameters to
//! a model could potentially affect the structure of a concretized Fusion, so
//! we take care to include those scalars in the input ID along with the extents
//! of tensor arguments.
//!
//! * note on unique computational graph
//! In theory, computational graph should refer to only the computational nodes
//! in a subgraph and should remain agnostic to input meta info, like
//! shape, strides, type e.t.c.. However, the contract right here is fuzzy.
//! Different executor applies their own protocol of what is a unique
//! computational graph. e.g. Legacy Executor embeds tensor type &
//! dimensionality in the graph, while Profiling Executor keeps symbolic shape
//! as well as stride order in the graph as well.
//!
//! Our definition of a "unique" computational graph is aligned with `Fusion`
//! IR, hence the requirement extends to meta information on input tensors.
//! Which means, for each input tensor, following properties are fixed:
//!     a) stride order;
//!     b) contiguity information;
//!     c) broadcasting semantics (size-1 or not);
//!     d) rank;
//!     e) scalar type;
//!
//! [ Note -- Segmented Fusion Tentative Design ]
//! Segmentation adds an extra dimension in caching. Initial implementation,
//! assumed graph partition strategy is independent of input pattern, which we
//! can revisit once we have more advanced graph segmentation logic Each
//! FusionExecutorCache corresponds to one graph and one graph segmentation.
