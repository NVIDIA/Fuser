/*
 * Short Description:
 *
 * Given an Expr in target_domain, check if its inputs are in replay_map. If so,
 * check if the mapped domain in replay_map are recorded to be transformed by an
 * "equivelent" operation in replay_domain's history. If so, forward the
 * operation and update replay_map to map the outputs of the expressions across
 * target_domain and reference_domain.
 *
 * Long Description:
 *
 * replay_map maps root IDs in the history of target_domain to root IDs in the
 * history replay_domain. PasC and CasP is just a convenient mechanism to have
 * BestEffortReplay make this base root mapping.
 *
 * Note: See ForwardingInfo in transform_iter.cpp for more information on
 * forwarding.
 *
 * Motivation:
 *
 * Consider the following program:
 *
 * T1[I0, R1] = T0[I0, I1]
 * T2[I0] = T1[I0, R1i]
 *
 * T1->split(1, factor)
 * T1->rFactor(2)
 *
 * T4[I0, R1orf, I1irf] = T0[I0, I1]
 * T1[I0, R1i] = T4[I0, R1orf, I1irf]
 * T2[I0] = T1[I0, R1i]
 *
 * There's an issue when we want to replay T4 to have transformations similar to
 * those on T0. Primarily T0's "rfactor" domain has a strict match requirement
 * on T4's root domain. If transformations on top of T0 don't match T4's
 * transformations (from T4's root domain to T4's rfactor domain), T4 cannot be
 * replayed like T0 on those domains as they would generate incorrect code in
 * the system today.
 *
 * Side note potentially for the future: In theory we could actually disconnect
 * T4's view from it's rfactor domain. This would allow rfactor domains to be
 * "reversible". The way this would have to be implemented is that there just
 * needs to be a path of transformations from a tensors leaf domains, to its
 * root domains, and its rfactor domain. It shouldn't really matter if those
 * connections are forward or backward through transformations. The only thing
 * that really matters is they're connected. This is left for future work as it
 * could have significant impact on other parts of the system like how loops are
 * generated and expressions are sorted.
 *
 * T0 doesn't have this constraint if we want to replay T0 as T4, so this is
 * directional based on rfactor. Therefore to replay T0 transformations onto T4
 * we want to make sure those transformations are consistent with T4 (between
 * T4's root and rfactor domain). Best Effort Replay does not actually add any
 * transformations to the tensors provided. However, it will provide information
 * to determine producers's transformations are consistent with consumers
 * transformations (or the other way around). Best Effort Replay will return
 * discovered mappings between tensors that it detects to be matching based on
 * provided initial information (or just through p2c/c2p root domain mappings).
 *
 * Transformations have a concept of "permissiveness" used for broadcast and
 * squeeze. For example:
 *
 * T1[I0, B1] = T0[I0]
 * T2[I0, I1] = T1[I0, B1]
 *
 * We may want to replay T1 and T0 based on transformations on T2. These
 * transformations may involve B1. We could even have:
 *
 * T2->merge(0, 1)->split(0, 128)
 *
 * resulting in:
 *
 * T2[(I0*I1)/128, 128]
 *
 * T0 doesn't have I1 so it can't technicaly be transformed in an exactly
 * consistent way. However, it may still be desired to "inline" T0 into T1 and
 * in result T1 into T2. It may further be desired to bind BIDx and TIDx to the
 * two dimensions in the problem. This example doesn't "technically" result in
 * thread to thread communication, but since our scope in mind is a shared
 * global memory it results in duplicate reads. These duplicate reads are
 * automatically cached in our memory hierarchy. So in a way there is implicit
 * communication in that a memory location is read by multiple threads.
 *
 * This is where forwarding and permissiveness come into play. When we transform
 * T1 with the first merge, we will mark the result I0*B1 of T1 to be
 * "permissively" mapped to I0 of T0, so when we perform the split, we split
 * T0's I0 dimension to I0/128 and 128. This is to help us mark inlining and
 * paralellization across these dimensions so we can effectively reason about
 * the "not full" dimension in T0. This is where the concept of forward map in
 * BestEffortReplay comes in.
 *
 * Permissiveness can also be considered "symmetric" across broadcast and
 * squeeze as they are similar operations, however broadcast and squeeze do have
 * different implications since squeeze doesn't result in the implicit
 * communication described in the previous paragraph. However, as far as
 * forwarding is concerned they're symmetric. Indexing/parallelization has
 * significant logic dedicated to broadcast resolutions (unlike squeeze).
 *
 * This class provides a mechanism to annalyze all of the above concepts. It
 * can also run through transformations in target according to a manually
 * specified IterDomain to IterDomain replay_map. If equal transformations
 * already exist in replay_domain history, we will not redo those
 * transformations, but instead update replay_map to reflect forwarding the
 * existing transformations based on a notion of expresions being "equal" (input
 * IterDomains mapped and transformation expression parameters matching, or the
 * iter domain that doesn't match is in a forwarding map). The replay map is the
 * "best effort" part of BestEffortReplay, it doesn't actually perform new
 * transformations to enforce matching, it just detects existing matching
 * transforms. However, we still include rfactor validation within.
