# Notes on Segmentation Changes for Host Scalar Execution

**Objective:** Modify the fusion segmenter to identify and potentially segment purely scalar computations for execution via a host-based executor (likely `ExprEvalExecutor` or similar using `ExpressionEvaluator`).

**Summary of Changes Implemented:**

1.  **`deriveSchedulerType` / `codeGenSupportedMerge` / `tryMerge` Modifications:**
    *   These functions rely on `Schedule::proposeHeuristics`.
    *   `Schedule::proposeHeuristics` correctly identifies segments containing only scalar operations (or segmentation hints) and returns `SchedulerType::ExprEval`.
    *   This allows merges resulting in purely scalar groups (targeted for host execution) to pass the schedulability check.

2.  **`buildInitialSegments`:**
    *   This function correctly creates initial `SegmentedGroup`s for individual scalar expressions, treating them like tensor expressions. Scalar dependencies are tracked via `SegmentedEdge`s from the start. Only true `Fusion` inputs are initially added to `input_vals_`.

3.  **Removal of Explicit Scalar Duplication Logic:**
    *   The previous mechanism for duplicating scalar computations into GPU segments (`SegmentCandidateFinder::resolveScalarsInGroup`) has been removed.
    *   Other special handling (like `removeScalarEdges`) has also been removed.

4.  **Finalization (`SegmentedGroup::finalize`, `SegmentedFusion::makeFusion`):**
    *   The finalization process now treats inter-segment dependencies uniformly for scalars and tensors.
    *   When `SegmentedFusion::makeFusion` creates the standalone `Fusion` for a segment, it correctly marks `Val`s (scalar or tensor) defined in *other* segments as inputs to the new `Fusion`.
    *   This leverages nvFuser's Input/Output Boundary Principle, preventing the inclusion or traversal of defining expressions from outside the segment and thus avoiding computation duplication.
5.  **Input Value Cleanup:** A cleanup pass was added to `SegmentCandidateFinder::finalize` to explicitly remove any `Val` from a group's `input_vals_` list if that `Val`'s defining expression exists within the same group's `exprs_` list. This corrects inconsistencies potentially introduced during merging.

**Current Status:**

*   The segmenter correctly creates initial scalar groups and tracks scalar edges.
*   The schedulability check identifies and allows purely scalar segments to be formed and marked `SchedulerType::ExprEval`.
*   The finalization step correctly respects segment boundaries for scalars (preventing duplication) and the **input metadata inconsistency previously observed appears resolved** thanks to the cleanup pass in `finalize`. The final printed segmentation graph shows correct inputs/outputs for the key segments.
*   **New Issue:** The test now fails with a **Segmentation Fault (Signal 11)** after the segmentation process completes (as indicated by the final state print occurring before the crash). This suggests a problem *after* the graph structure is determined, likely involving:
    *   Dangling pointers or use-after-free issues related to `SegmentedGroup` objects or `Val`/`Expr` objects during/after merging and erasure steps (`mergeNodes`, `eraseGroups`).
    *   Incorrect state being passed to or used by downstream components (scheduler, code generator, runtime) due to subtle graph inconsistencies not caught by previous checks.
*   The orphaned placeholder input groups for original global inputs still remain after segmentation, representing minor technical debt.

**Outstanding Items:**

*   **Debug Segmentation Fault:** Investigate the cause of the segfault. This likely requires using a debugger (GDB) to get a stack trace at the crash location or adding more fine-grained checks/prints around group merging, erasure, and the subsequent usage of the `SegmentedFusion` object by the runtime/scheduler. Focus on pointer validity and object lifetimes after graph manipulation, especially within `resolveForwardedInputs` and `mergeNodes`.
*   **Runtime Host-to-GPU Scalar Value Passing (External):** While the segmentation logic now correctly defines the graph structure and input requirements, the runtime executor system must handle the actual process of passing scalar values between host and GPU segments. *(This component is assumed to be handled outside the segmentation logic itself).*
*   **Cleanup Orphaned Placeholder Groups:** Implement logic (likely in `SegmentCandidateFinder::finalize`) to remove the empty placeholder groups associated with original fusion inputs that don't participate in forwarding.
*   **Testing and Debugging:** Once the segfault is resolved, continue with broader testing.

## Validation Case: `FusionScalarUnarySegmentation_CUDA`

This test case is crucial for validating the scalar segmentation changes.

**Graph Structure:**

1.  **Inputs:** `tv0` (Tensor), `s0`, `s1`, `s2` (Scalar Double).
2.  **Scalar Block:** A chain of scalar arithmetic (`*`, `/`, `+`, `-`) operations using `s0, s1, s2` to produce a final scalar `scalar_final`.
3.  **Tensor Unary Chain:** `tv0 -> Neg -> Abs -> Relu -> tv3`.
4.  **Combination:** `tv4 = Mul(tv3, scalar_final)`.
5.  **Output Paths (Diverging from `tv4`):**
    *   Path 0 (Partial Reduction): `Sum(tv4, {0}) -> tv5`, then `Add(tv5, tv4) -> output0`.
    *   Path 1 (Full Reduction): `Sum(tv4, {0, 1}) -> tv6`, then `Add(tv6, tv4) -> output1`.

**Expected Segmentation Behavior:**

1.  **Input Forwarding:** The unary chain `tv0 -> tv1 -> tv2 -> tv3` should be forwarded. The `Neg`, `Abs`, `Relu` expressions will be duplicated later.
2.  **Initial Groups:** Individual groups for each scalar op, tensor op (`Mul` for `tv4`, `Sum`s, `Add`s), and placeholders for inputs (`s0, s1, s2`, forwarded `tv3`).
3.  **Merging & Scheduling:**
    *   The scalar ops defining `scalar_final` should merge into a single segment scheduled as **`SchedulerType::ExprEval`**.
    *   The tensor ops (`Mul` producing `tv4`, the two `Sum`s, the two `Add`s) will initially be separate groups.
    *   The two reduction paths (`tv4 -> tv5 -> output0` and `tv4 -> tv6 -> output1`) will likely form distinct GPU segments (e.g., `SchedulerType::Reduction`).
4.  **Finalization:**
    *   `resolveForwardedInputs`: The `Neg, Abs, Relu` ops will be prepended into the segment(s) consuming `tv3`. Given the likely merging behavior, these unary ops might end up being duplicated into *both* the final reduction segments (Segment 3 and Segment 4 below).
    *   `makeFusion` for the **scalar segment**: Inputs `s0, s1, s2`. Output `scalar_final`.
    *   `makeFusion` for **GPU segments consuming `scalar_final`**: `scalar_final` will be marked as an input (`Fusion::addInput`). Its defining scalar expressions will NOT be included in these GPU `Fusion` objects.
    *   Similarly, `tv4` will be marked as an input for the reduction segments.

**Expected Final Segments (High Likelihood):**
*   **Segment 1 (Host):** `SchedulerType::ExprEval`. Inputs: `s0, s1, s2`. Computes `scalar_final`. Output: `scalar_final`.
*   **Segment 2 (GPU):** `SchedulerType::Reduction` (or similar GPU type). Inputs: `tv0`, `scalar_final`. Computes `tv1, tv2, tv3` (prepended), `tv4`, `tv5`, `output0`. Output: `output0`.
*   **Segment 3 (GPU):** `SchedulerType::Reduction` (or similar GPU type). Inputs: `tv0`, `scalar_final`. Computes `tv1, tv2, tv3` (prepended), `tv4`, `tv6`, `output1`. Output: `output1`.

*(Note: It's possible Segment 2 and 3 might have slightly different structures or scheduler types depending on heuristics, but the key expectation is the clear separation of the scalar block (Segment 1) and the duplication of the pointwise/unary logic into the consuming reduction segments. The inputs/outputs listed are the *true* external dependencies.)*

**Observed Segmentation Results (from LATEST Test Log before Segfault):**

*   **Segment 1 (Host):** `expr_eval{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}` (ID 5). Inputs Listed: `d3, d4, d5`. Output Listed: `d20`. **Matches expectation.**
*   **Segment 2 (GPU):** `outer_persistent{8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}` (ID 6). Inputs Listed: `T0_g_float`, `d20`. Outputs Listed: `T4_g_float`, `T7_g_float`. Contains unary chain (8-10), Mul (11), Path 0 Reduction (12-13), Path 0 Add (14). **Matches expectation.** (The previous issue with `T3` listed as input is resolved).
*   **Segment 3 (GPU):** `reduction{15, 16}` (ID 4). Inputs Listed: `T4_g_float`. Outputs Listed: `T9_g_float`. Contains Path 1 Reduction (15-16). **Matches expectation.**
*   **Segment 4 (GPU):** `pointwise{17}` (ID 3). Inputs Listed: `T4_g_float`, `T9_g_float`. Outputs Listed: `T10_g_float`. Contains Path 1 Add (17). **Matches expectation.**
*   **Other:** Placeholder `expr_eval` groups (ID 0, 1, 2) for original scalar inputs remain.

**Importance of this Test Case:**

*   Validates Scalar Segment Creation.
*   Validates Boundary Handling (Scalar duplication is prevented, Input metadata is now correct).
*   Tests Scalar/Tensor Interaction.
*   Tests Duplication/Recomputation via input forwarding.

**Current Issues Logged:**

1.  **Segmentation Fault:** The test crashes with Signal 11 after segmentation completes and the final state is printed. This points to issues in later stages (scheduling, codegen, runtime setup) likely caused by dangling pointers or memory issues resulting from the group manipulation during segmentation.
2.  **Orphaned Placeholder Input Groups:** The initial placeholder groups created for the original scalar inputs (`d3, d4, d5` -> IDs 0, 1, 2) are not removed.

**Next Step:** Debug the Segmentation Fault, likely using GDB to identify the exact point of failure after segmentation. Examine object lifetimes and pointer validity around the merge/erase operations.
