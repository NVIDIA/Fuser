# nvFuser Documentation

## Purpose and Goals

This documentation is designed to provide high-level architectural context and design principles that are not easily discernible from reading individual source code files. It serves multiple critical purposes:

### AI-Assisted Development
- Provides rich context for AI agents to generate more accurate and coherent code
- Enables better code generation through enhanced context awareness
- Facilitates easier documentation updates by correlating code changes with architectural context
- Helps identify when code changes invalidate existing documentation

### Learning and Onboarding
- Serves as an interactive tutorial for new developers
- Enables AI agents to guide developers through the codebase effectively
- Helps developers quickly understand nvFuser's design principles
- Provides context for making design decisions that align with nvFuser's architecture

### API Development
- Supports the creation of high-quality user-facing APIs (e.g., Python bindings)
- Ensures new APIs maintain architectural consistency
- Provides context for API design decisions
- Helps maintain coherence between different API layers
