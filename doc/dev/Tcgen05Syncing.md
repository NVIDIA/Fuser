## 1. Overview

The tcgen05 instruction family provides tensor memory operations for modern GPU architectures (Hopper+). Unlike other asynchronous operations, tcgen05 instructions have specific synchronization dependencies that determine when fences are required vs. when operations can be automatically pipelined.

For complete instruction details, see the [PTX ISA tcgen05 Instructions Reference](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05).

**Key Concepts:**
- **Generic Proxy**: Traditional CUDA execution context for most operations
- **Async Proxy**: Specialized execution context for high-throughput async operations
- **Code Motion Fence**: Prevents instruction reordering (not memory ordering)
- **Memory Fence**: Ensures memory visibility between execution contexts

## 2. tcgen05 Instruction Categories

Based on [PTX ISA Section 9.7.16.6.2](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-memory-consistency-model-pipelined-instructions), tcgen05 instructions fall into several categories with different synchronization requirements:

### 2.1. Control Instructions (Generic Proxy)
- [`tcgen05.alloc`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-alloc) - Allocate tensor memory
- [`tcgen05.dealloc`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-dealloc) - Deallocate tensor memory
- [`tcgen05.relinquish_alloc_permit`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-relinquish-alloc-permit) - Release allocation permit

### 2.2. Data Movement Instructions (Generic Proxy)
- [`tcgen05.ld`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-ld) - Load data to tensor memory
- [`tcgen05.st`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-st) - Store data from tensor memory
- [`tcgen05.wait::ld`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-wait) - Wait for load completion
- [`tcgen05.wait::st`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-wait) - Wait for store completion

### 2.3. Compute Instructions (Async Proxy)
- [`tcgen05.mma`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-mma) - Matrix multiply-accumulate operation
- [`tcgen05.cp`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-cp) - Copy operation between memory spaces
- [`tcgen05.shift`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-shift) - Shift tensor data (asynchronous operation)

**Note**: `tcgen05.mma`, `tcgen05.cp`, and `tcgen05.shift` are confirmed to execute in the Async Proxy context and use mbarrier completion per [PTX ISA Section 9.7.16.6.4](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-memory-consistency-model-mbarrier-completion).

### 2.4. Commit Instructions (Generic Proxy)
- [`tcgen05.commit`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-commit) - Commit operations with mbarrier synchronization

### 2.5. Fence Instructions (Generic Proxy)
- [`tcgen05.fence::before_thread_sync`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-fence) - Code motion fence before synchronization
- [`tcgen05.fence::after_thread_sync`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-fence) - Code motion fence after synchronization

## 3. Completion Mechanisms

tcgen05 instructions use two distinct completion mechanisms, with each instruction having a fixed completion mechanism determined by its design. Understanding which instructions use which mechanism is crucial for proper synchronization.

### 3.1. MBarrier Completion (tcgen05.commit)

The [`tcgen05.commit`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-commit) instruction provides **batch-oriented completion** by signaling an mbarrier when **mbarrier-based tcgen05 operations** complete.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **MBarrier-specific** - Only completes operations that use mbarrier completion mechanism
- **Batch completion** - Single commit operation can complete multiple outstanding mbarrier-based operations
- **Async proxy operations** - Primarily used for `tcgen05.mma` and `tcgen05.cp` operations

**Usage Pattern:**
```cuda
// Start mbarrier-based tcgen05 operations
tcgen05.alloc.cta_group::1.sync.aligned.shared::cta.b32 [addr], size;

// These operations use direct wait completion (NOT tcgen05.commit)
tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem_a], [smem_a];
tcgen05.wait::ld.sync.aligned [tmem_a];  // Use tcgen05.wait::ld for loads

tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem_b], [smem_b];
tcgen05.wait::ld.sync.aligned [tmem_b];  // Use tcgen05.wait::ld for loads

// This operation uses mbarrier completion
tcgen05.mma.cta_group::1.kind::f16 [acc], [tmem_a], [tmem_b], idesc, enable;

// Signal completion of mbarrier-based operations only
tcgen05.commit.cta_group::1.mbarrier::arrive::one.shared::cta.b64 [mbar];

// Wait for mbarrier-based operations to complete
mbarrier.wait.shared.b64 [mbar], expected_state;

// Store results using direct wait completion
tcgen05.st.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [smem_out], [acc];
tcgen05.wait::st.sync.aligned [smem_out];  // Use tcgen05.wait::st for stores
```

**Required For:**
- `tcgen05.mma` operations (no other completion mechanism available)
- `tcgen05.cp` operations (no other completion mechanism available)
- Operations that explicitly use mbarrier completion mechanism

### 3.2. Direct Wait Completion (tcgen05.wait)

The [`tcgen05.wait`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-wait) instruction provides **operation-specific completion** by directly waiting for individual tcgen05 operations.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Fine-grained control** - Wait for specific operations individually
- **Direct completion** - No mbarrier setup required
- **Operation-specific** - Wait for individual `ld` and `st` operations only

**Usage Pattern:**
```cuda
// Start specific operations
tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem_a], [smem_a];
tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem_b], [smem_b];

// Wait for specific loads to complete before MMA
tcgen05.wait::ld.cta_group::1 [tmem_a];
tcgen05.wait::ld.cta_group::1 [tmem_b];

// Now safe to use loaded data
tcgen05.mma.cta_group::1.kind::f16 [acc], [tmem_a], [tmem_b], idesc, enable;

// Note: tcgen05.mma can only be completed via tcgen05.commit + mbarrier
// Direct wait on mma operations is not supported
tcgen05.commit.cta_group::1 [mbar];
mbarrier.wait.shared.b64 [mbar], expected_state;

// Store results (uses direct wait completion)
tcgen05.st.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [smem_out], [acc];
tcgen05.wait::st.sync.aligned [smem_out];
```

**Available For:**
- `tcgen05.ld`, `tcgen05.st` operations only (via `tcgen05.wait::ld`, `tcgen05.wait::st`)
- Fine-grained synchronization when individual operation completion is needed

### 3.3. tcgen05 Instruction Completion Reference

The following table shows which completion mechanism and execution context each tcgen05 instruction uses:

| Instruction | Execution Context | Completion Mechanism | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------|-------|
| [`tcgen05.alloc`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-alloc) | Generic Proxy | None (synchronous) | Allocation completes immediately |
| [`tcgen05.dealloc`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-dealloc) | Generic Proxy | None (synchronous) | Deallocation completes immediately |
| [`tcgen05.ld`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-ld) | Generic Proxy | `tcgen05.wait::ld` only | Load data from memory to tensor memory |
| [`tcgen05.st`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-st) | Generic Proxy | `tcgen05.wait::st` only | Store data from tensor memory to memory |
| [`tcgen05.shift`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-shift) | Async Proxy | `tcgen05.commit` only | Shift tensor data (asynchronous operation) |
| [`tcgen05.cp`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-cp) | Async Proxy | `tcgen05.commit` only | Copy operations between memory spaces |
| [`tcgen05.mma`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-mma) | Async Proxy | `tcgen05.commit` only | Matrix multiply-accumulate operations |
| [`tcgen05.wait`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-wait) | Generic Proxy | N/A (completion instruction) | Waits for specific operation completion |
| [`tcgen05.commit`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-commit) | Generic Proxy | N/A (completion instruction) | Signals mbarrier when operations complete |
| [`tcgen05.fence`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-tcgen05-fence) | Generic Proxy | None (code motion only) | Prevents instruction reordering |

#### 3.3.1. Key Observations

- **Load/store operations** (`ld`, `st`) use **direct wait completion** (`tcgen05.wait::ld/st` only)
- **Async operations** (`cp`, `mma`, `shift`) use **mbarrier completion** (`tcgen05.commit` only)
- **Completion mechanisms are fixed** - each instruction type has exactly one completion mechanism
- **Control operations** (`alloc`, `dealloc`, `fence`) complete synchronously or provide code motion barriers
- **All tcgen05 operations** execute in either Generic Proxy or Async Proxy context
- **Completion instructions** (`wait`, `commit`) always execute in Generic Proxy

### 3.4. Completion Pattern Examples

**MBarrier Completion Pattern (Required for `tcgen05.mma`):**
```cuda
// Batch completion - required for mma operations
for (int tile = 0; tile < num_tiles; ++tile) {
    tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem_a], [smem + tile_offset];
tcgen05.mma.cta_group::1.kind::f16 [acc], [tmem_a], [tmem_b], idesc, enable;
}
tcgen05.commit.cta_group::1 [mbar];  // Single bulk completion
mbarrier.arrive_wait_expect_tx.shared::cta.b64 token, [mbar], old_token, count;
```

**Direct Wait Completion Pattern (Available for load/store only):**
```cuda
// Individual waits - only available for ld/st operations
tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem_a], [smem_a];
tcgen05.wait::ld.sync.aligned;  // Wait for this specific load

tcgen05.st.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [smem_out], [tmem_a];
tcgen05.wait::st.sync.aligned;  // Wait for this specific store
```

## 4. Synchronization Dependencies

**Rule of Thumb**: tcgen05 operations are generally **NOT** automatically pipelined with each other. When in doubt, use explicit synchronization (`tcgen05.wait::*` or `tcgen05.commit` + mbarrier). Only the specific combinations documented in the PTX ISA are guaranteed to be automatically pipelined.

### 4.1. Dependency Matrix

> **⚠️ INCOMPLETE**: This matrix contains assumptions that need verification based on PTX ISA documentation. See [question 10.3](#103-automatic-pipelining-rules) for details.

**📚 Verification Source**: [PTX ISA Section 9.7.16.6.2: tcgen05 Memory Consistency Model - Pipelined Instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-memory-consistency-model-pipelined-instructions)
Specifically refer to the **"Implicitly pipelined tcgen05 instructions"** subsection for authoritative pipelining rules.

The following matrix shows pipelining relationships between tcgen05 instructions. Each cell indicates whether the Producer → Consumer relationship is automatically pipelined or requires explicit synchronization.

**Legend:**
- ✅ **Pipelined**: Operations are automatically pipelined (no fence needed) - Links point to PTX ISA documentation that confirms the relationship
- ❌ **Manual Sync**: Requires explicit synchronization (fence or wait)
- ⚠️ **Conditional**: Pipelining depends on specific conditions
- ❓ **Unknown**: Needs verification from PTX ISA documentation
- `NA` **Not Applicable**: Code motion fences have different semantics than data dependencies

**How to Read the Matrix:**
- **Row** = Producer instruction (executes first)
- **Column** = Consumer instruction (executes second)
- **Cell Value** = Synchronization requirement for Producer → Consumer ordering

**Matrix Analysis:**

**✅ Explicitly Documented Pipelined Relationships:**
- **Completion Mechanisms** (with PTX ISA links):
  - `ld` → `wait::ld`: Direct wait completion for loads
  - `st` → `wait::st`: Direct wait completion for stores
  - `shift` → `commit`: MBarrier completion for shift operations
  - `cp` → `commit`: MBarrier completion for copy operations
  - `mma` → `commit`: MBarrier completion for MMA operations

- **Async Operation Pipelining** (PTX ISA Section 9.7.16.6.2.1 - exactly 5 relationships):
  1. `shift` → `cp`: shift operations pipeline to copy operations (`tcgen05.shift.cta_group::N` → `tcgen05.cp.4x256b.cta_group::N`)
  2. `shift` → `mma`: shift operations pipeline to MMA operations (`tcgen05.shift.cta_group::N` → `tcgen05.mma.cta_group::N`)
  3. `cp` → `mma`: copy operations pipeline to MMA operations (`tcgen05.copy.cta_group::N` → `tcgen05.mma.cta_group::N`)
  4. `mma` → `shift`: MMA operations pipeline to shift operations (`tcgen05.mma.cta_group::N` → `tcgen05.shift.cta_group::N`)
  5. `mma` → `mma`: MMA operations pipeline to MMA operations with same accumulator (`tcgen05.mma.cta_group::N` → `tcgen05.mma.cta_group::N`)

**❓ Unknown/Verification Needed:**
- All `alloc` relationships: No explicit pipelining documentation found
- `st` → `dealloc`: Not explicitly documented
- `wait` instruction interactions: Limited documentation on wait-to-wait dependencies
- Most other operation pairs not explicitly documented in PTX ISA Section 9.7.16.6.2.1

**❌ Manual Synchronization Required:**
- Most operation pairs not explicitly listed above
- Cross-proxy transitions without documented pipelining
- Operations requiring explicit waits or commit mechanisms

**`NA` Not Applicable:**
- All `fence` relationships: Code motion fences control instruction reordering, not data dependencies

**Key Findings:**
1. Only relationships explicitly documented in PTX ISA Section 9.7.16.6.2.1 and completion mechanism sections are marked as pipelined (✅)
2. **Critical diagonal analysis**: Only `mma` → `mma` is explicitly documented as pipelined (same accumulator and shape). All other same-type operations (`alloc` → `alloc`, `ld` → `ld`, `st` → `st`, etc.) are marked as ❌ since they lack explicit pipelining documentation
3. The absence of explicit pipelining documentation for same-type operations suggests they require explicit synchronization

### 4.2. Automatic Pipelining

> **⚠️ INCOMPLETE**: The examples below may contain incorrect assumptions. Only the specific combinations listed in the [PTX ISA "Implicitly pipelined tcgen05 instructions" section](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-memory-consistency-model-pipelined-instructions) are guaranteed to be pipelined.

**Important**: According to the PTX ISA documentation, "The asynchronous tcgen05 operations may execute and complete in a different order than they were issued." Only explicitly documented pipelined combinations should be assumed to work without fences.

The following instruction sequences are **claimed to be automatically pipelined** but **need verification against PTX ISA**:

```cuda
// ✅ No fence needed - automatic pipelining
tcgen05.alloc.cta_group::1.sync.aligned.shared::cta.b32 [addr], size;
tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem], [smem];  // Auto-pipelined

// ✅ No fence needed - automatic pipelining
tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem], [smem];
tcgen05.cp.async.bulk.shared::cluster.global.mbarrier::complete_tx::bytes [dest], [src], size, [mbar];  // Auto-pipelined

// ✅ No fence needed - automatic pipelining
tcgen05.cp.async.bulk.shared::cluster.global.mbarrier::complete_tx::bytes [dest], [src], size, [mbar];
tcgen05.mma.cta_group::1.kind::f16 [acc], [tmem_a], [tmem_b], idesc, enable;  // Auto-pipelined

// ✅ No fence needed - automatic pipelining
tcgen05.mma.cta_group::1.kind::f16 [acc], [tmem_a], [tmem_b], idesc, enable;
tcgen05.st.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [smem], [tmem];  // Auto-pipelined
```

### 4.3. Required Fences

Fences are **required** when tcgen05 operations interact with thread synchronization:

```cuda
// ⚠️ Code motion fence needed before thread synchronization
tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem], [smem];
tcgen05.fence::before_thread_sync;  // Required
__syncthreads();

// ⚠️ Code motion fence needed after thread synchronization
__syncthreads();
tcgen05.fence::after_thread_sync;  // Required
tcgen05.st.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [smem], [tmem];
```

## 5. Code Motion Fences

tcgen05 fence instructions are **code motion fences**, not memory fences. They prevent compiler optimizations from reordering tcgen05 instructions across synchronization boundaries, which is essential for preserving intended synchronization semantics during instruction-level parallelism (ILP) optimizations.

### 5.1. `tcgen05.fence::before_thread_sync`
- **Purpose**: Prevents reordering of tcgen05 instructions before thread synchronization
- **Usage**: Place before `__syncthreads()`, barriers, or other sync primitives
- **Effect**: Code motion only - no memory ordering guarantees

**Example of Invalid Reordering Without Fence:**
```cuda
// Original PTX code (intended behavior)
tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem], [smem_input];
tcgen05.mma.cta_group::1.kind::f16 [acc], [tmem], [tmem_b], idesc, 1;
__syncthreads();  // All threads must complete their MMA before proceeding

// ❌ INVALID: Compiler might reorder without fence (breaks synchronization)
__syncthreads();  // Moved up - threads sync before MMA completes!
tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem], [smem_input];
tcgen05.mma.cta_group::1.kind::f16 [acc], [tmem], [tmem_b], idesc, 1;

// ✅ CORRECT: With fence, reordering is prevented
tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem], [smem_input];
tcgen05.mma.cta_group::1.kind::f16 [acc], [tmem], [tmem_b], idesc, 1;
tcgen05.fence::before_thread_sync;  // Prevents tcgen05 from moving past sync
__syncthreads();
```

### 5.2. `tcgen05.fence::after_thread_sync`
- **Purpose**: Prevents reordering of tcgen05 instructions after thread synchronization
- **Usage**: Place after `__syncthreads()`, barriers, or other sync primitives
- **Effect**: Code motion only - no memory ordering guarantees

**Example of Invalid Reordering Without Fence:**
```cuda
// Original PTX code (intended behavior)
__syncthreads();  // Ensure all threads reach this point
tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem], [smem_shared];
tcgen05.mma.cta_group::1.kind::f16 [acc], [tmem], [tmem_b], idesc, 1;

// ❌ INVALID: Compiler might reorder without fence (breaks synchronization)
tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem], [smem_shared];  // Moved up!
tcgen05.mma.cta_group::1.kind::f16 [acc], [tmem], [tmem_b], idesc, 1;
__syncthreads();  // Some threads might access uninitialized shared memory

// ✅ CORRECT: With fence, reordering is prevented
__syncthreads();
tcgen05.fence::after_thread_sync;  // Prevents tcgen05 from moving before sync
tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem], [smem_shared];
tcgen05.mma.cta_group::1.kind::f16 [acc], [tmem], [tmem_b], idesc, 1;
```

### 5.3. Why Code Motion Fences Are Necessary

The compilation pipeline includes several optimization phases:
1. **PTX to SASS compilation** transforms high-level PTX to machine code
2. **Instruction scheduling** reorders instructions for better ILP and latency hiding
3. **Register allocation** may further affect instruction ordering

Without `tcgen05.fence` instructions, the optimizer might:
- Move `tcgen05` operations across `__syncthreads()` boundaries
- Violate intended synchronization semantics
- Create race conditions or data hazards
- Break the assumption that all threads complete operations before synchronization

**Important**: tcgen05 fences do **NOT** provide memory ordering between generic and async execution contexts. Use [`fence.proxy.async`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-fence-proxy) for memory ordering.

## 6. Proxy Execution Context

tcgen05 operations span both execution contexts:

### 6.1. Generic Proxy Operations
- `tcgen05.alloc`, `tcgen05.dealloc`, `tcgen05.relinquish_alloc_permit`
- `tcgen05.ld`, `tcgen05.st`, `tcgen05.wait::*`
- `tcgen05.commit`
- `tcgen05.fence::*`

### 6.2. Async Proxy Operations
- `tcgen05.mma` (matrix multiply-accumulate operations)
- `tcgen05.cp` (asynchronous copy operations)

Both operations are confirmed to execute in the Async Proxy context per [PTX ISA Section 9.7.16.6.5](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-memory-consistency-model-smem-access).

### 6.3. Memory Ordering Requirements

**Memory visibility** between proxy contexts requires explicit fences when shared memory is accessed by both Generic and Async proxy operations. This is distinct from execution ordering - even if instructions execute in the correct order, memory visibility between proxy contexts is not guaranteed without explicit fences.

**tcgen05-Specific Requirements:**
- **No implicit proxy fences**: Unlike WgMMA operations, tcgen05 instructions do NOT include implicit `fence.proxy.async`
- **User responsibility**: Explicit `fence.proxy.async` must be inserted when transitioning between proxy contexts
- **Memory visibility**: Required when Generic Proxy writes shared memory consumed by tcgen05 async operations, or vice versa

```cuda
// Generic Proxy → Async Proxy (tcgen05)
st.shared.f32 [smem], value;                    // Generic proxy writes
fence.proxy.async.shared::cta;                  // REQUIRED: Memory visibility fence
tcgen05.mma.cta_group::1.kind::f16 [acc], ...;  // Async proxy reads

// Async Proxy (tcgen05) → Generic Proxy
tcgen05.mma.cta_group::1.kind::f16 [acc], ...;  // Async proxy writes
fence.proxy.async.shared::cta;                  // REQUIRED: Memory visibility fence
ld.shared.f32 result, [smem];                   // Generic proxy reads
```

**Contrast with WgMMA:**
```cuda
// WgMMA includes implicit proxy fence upon completion
wgmma.mma_async.sync.aligned.m16n8k32.f16.f16.f16.f16 [acc], [smem_a], [smem_b];
wgmma.commit_group.sync.aligned;
wgmma.wait_group.sync.aligned 0;  // Implicit fence.proxy.async upon completion
ld.shared.f32 result, [smem];     // NO explicit fence needed
```

## 8. Examples

### 8.1. Example 1: Simple tcgen05 Pipeline (No Fences Needed)

```cuda
// All operations automatically pipelined - no explicit fences required
tcgen05.alloc.cta_group::1.sync.aligned.shared::cta.b32 [tmem_addr], 1024;

// Load operations with direct wait completion
tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem_addr], [smem_a];
tcgen05.wait::ld.sync.aligned [tmem_addr];  // Complete load A

tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem_addr+512], [smem_b];
tcgen05.wait::ld.sync.aligned [tmem_addr+512];  // Complete load B

// MMA operation with mbarrier completion
tcgen05.mma.cta_group::1.kind::f16 [acc], [tmem_addr], [tmem_addr+512], idesc, 1;
tcgen05.commit.cta_group::1.mbarrier::arrive::one.shared::cta.b64 [mbar];
mbarrier.wait.shared.b64 [mbar], expected_state;  // Complete MMA

// Store operation with direct wait completion
tcgen05.st.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [smem_c], [acc];
tcgen05.wait::st.sync.aligned [smem_c];  // Complete store

tcgen05.dealloc.cta_group::1.sync.aligned.shared::cta [tmem_addr];
```

### 8.2. Example 2: tcgen05 with Thread Synchronization (Fences Required)

```cuda
// Phase 1: Load data
tcgen05.alloc.cta_group::1.sync.aligned.shared::cta.b32 [tmem], 1024;
tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem], [smem_input];
tcgen05.wait::ld.sync.aligned [tmem];  // Complete load

// Code motion fence before thread sync
tcgen05.fence::before_thread_sync;
__syncthreads();  // All threads wait

// Code motion fence after thread sync
tcgen05.fence::after_thread_sync;

// Phase 2: Compute and store
tcgen05.mma.cta_group::1.kind::f16 [acc], [tmem], [tmem], idesc, 1;
tcgen05.commit.cta_group::1.mbarrier::arrive::one.shared::cta.b64 [mbar];
mbarrier.wait.shared.b64 [mbar], expected_state;  // Complete MMA

tcgen05.st.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [smem_output], [acc];
tcgen05.wait::st.sync.aligned [smem_output];  // Complete store

tcgen05.dealloc.cta_group::1.sync.aligned.shared::cta [tmem];
```

### 8.3. Example 3: tcgen05 with Proxy Context Transitions

```cuda
// Generic proxy stores data that will be used by tcgen05.mma
st.shared.f32 [operand_a_buffer], computed_value_a;
st.shared.f32 [operand_b_buffer], computed_value_b;
fence.proxy.async.shared::cta;  // Memory ordering fence

// tcgen05 pipeline
tcgen05.alloc.cta_group::1.sync.aligned.shared::cta.b32 [tmem_a], 1024;
tcgen05.alloc.cta_group::1.sync.aligned.shared::cta.b32 [tmem_b], 1024;

// Load operands with completion
tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem_a], [operand_a_buffer];
tcgen05.wait::ld.sync.aligned [tmem_a];  // Complete load A

tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem_b], [operand_b_buffer];
tcgen05.wait::ld.sync.aligned [tmem_b];  // Complete load B

// MMA with proper operands and completion
tcgen05.mma.cta_group::1.kind::f16 [acc], [tmem_a], [tmem_b], idesc, 1;
tcgen05.commit.cta_group::1.mbarrier::arrive::one.shared::cta.b64 [mbar];
mbarrier.wait.shared.b64 [mbar], expected_state;  // Complete MMA

// Store result with completion
tcgen05.st.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [result_buffer], [acc];
tcgen05.wait::st.sync.aligned [result_buffer];  // Complete store

// tcgen05.mma results used by generic proxy
fence.proxy.async.shared::cta;  // REQUIRED: No implicit fence in tcgen05
ld.shared.f32 final_result, [result_buffer];

// Cleanup
tcgen05.dealloc.cta_group::1.sync.aligned.shared::cta [tmem_a];
tcgen05.dealloc.cta_group::1.sync.aligned.shared::cta [tmem_b];
```

### 8.4. Example 4: Complete tcgen05 Pattern with Mixed Completion Mechanisms

```cuda
// Allocate tensor memory for two operands
tcgen05.alloc.cta_group::1.sync.aligned.shared::cta.b32 [tmem_a], 1024;
tcgen05.alloc.cta_group::1.sync.aligned.shared::cta.b32 [tmem_b], 1024;

// Load data to tensor memory (uses direct wait completion)
tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem_a], [smem_a];
tcgen05.wait::ld.sync.aligned [tmem_a];  // Complete load A

tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem_b], [smem_b];
tcgen05.wait::ld.sync.aligned [tmem_b];  // Complete load B

// Perform matrix multiply-accumulate (uses mbarrier completion)
tcgen05.mma.cta_group::1.kind::f16 [acc], [tmem_a], [tmem_b], idesc, 1;

// Commit mbarrier-based operations (only mma in this case)
tcgen05.commit.cta_group::1.mbarrier::arrive::one.shared::cta.b64 [mbar];
mbarrier.wait.shared.b64 [mbar], expected_state;  // Complete MMA

// Memory ordering fence for proxy transition (tcgen05 requires explicit fence)
fence.proxy.async.shared::cta;

// Store MMA results to shared memory for generic proxy use
tcgen05.st.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [smem_result], [acc];
tcgen05.wait::st.sync.aligned [smem_result];  // Complete store

// Use results in generic proxy (load from shared memory)
ld.shared.f32 final_result, [smem_result];

// Clean up tensor memory
tcgen05.dealloc.cta_group::1.sync.aligned.shared::cta [tmem_a];
tcgen05.dealloc.cta_group::1.sync.aligned.shared::cta [tmem_b];
```

## 9. Performance Considerations

### 9.1. Minimizing Fence Overhead

1. **Leverage Automatic Pipelining**: Most tcgen05 → tcgen05 operations don't need fences
2. **Minimize Thread Synchronization**: Reduce `__syncthreads()` calls to avoid code motion fences
3. **Batch Proxy Transitions**: Group operations to minimize `fence.proxy.async` usage
4. **Use MBarrier Efficiently**: Prefer mbarrier-based sync over traditional barriers



## 10. Questions and Ambiguous Behaviors

The following behaviors need clarification or verification against PTX ISA documentation:

### 10.1. tcgen05.wait Instruction Variants
**Question**: Does `tcgen05.wait::mma` or `tcgen05.wait::cp` actually exist, or can those operations only be completed via `tcgen05.commit`?
- **Current assumption**: Only certain wait variants are available, need to verify which ones
- **Needs verification**: PTX ISA documentation for complete list of wait variants

**Answer**: According to the [PTX ISA documentation for tcgen05.wait](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-instructions-tcgen05-wait), the syntax specification shows:
```
tcgen05.wait_operation.sync.aligned;

.wait_operation = { .wait::ld, .wait::st }
```
This means **only** `tcgen05.wait::ld.sync.aligned` and `tcgen05.wait::st.sync.aligned` are supported. There is **no** `tcgen05.wait::mma` or `tcgen05.wait::cp` instruction variant.

### 10.2. Proxy Context for tcgen05.cp
**Question**: The document claims `tcgen05.cp` executes in Async Proxy, but this needs verification.
- **Current assumption**: Based on it being a copy operation similar to async bulk operations
- **Needs verification**: PTX ISA documentation for execution context

**Answer**: According to [Section 9.7.16.6.5 of the PTX ISA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-memory-consistency-model-smem-access), both `tcgen05.mma` and `tcgen05.cp` use shared memory accesses in the async proxy. This confirms that **`tcgen05.cp` executes in the Async Proxy context**, as documented in our instruction completion reference table.

### 10.3. Automatic Pipelining Rules
**Question**: Are the automatic pipelining rules in the dependency matrix complete and accurate?
- **Current assumption**: Based on PTX ISA section 9.7.16.6.2 description
- **Needs verification**: Complete testing or official documentation of all pipelining scenarios

**Answer**: The current dependency matrix is **incomplete and contains incorrect assumptions**. According to the [PTX ISA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-memory-consistency-model-pipelined-instructions):

> "The asynchronous tcgen05 operations may execute and complete in a different order than they were issued."

**Key Correction**: **NOT all tcgen05 → tcgen05 operations are automatically pipelined**. Only the specific combinations listed in the PTX ISA documentation under "Implicitly pipelined tcgen05 instructions" are guaranteed to be pipelined. Other pairings may execute in a different order than issued and should not be assumed to be pipelined.

The dependency matrix in section 4.1 needs to be revised to only include the explicitly documented pipelined combinations from the PTX ISA, rather than assuming all tcgen05 operations are automatically pipelined.

### 10.4. Memory Ordering Between Contexts
**Question**: When exactly is `fence.proxy.async` required vs. optional for tcgen05 operations?
- **Current assumption**: Required when transitioning between Generic and Async proxy contexts
- **Needs verification**: Specific rules for tcgen05 operations vs. other async operations

**Answer**: Although execution ordering of instructions may be correct, **memory visibility** between proxy contexts requires explicit fences when one instruction accesses shared memory in the async proxy and another in the generic proxy. A `fence.proxy.async[.shared::cta]` is needed unless there's an implicit fence from a previously completed instruction.

**Key Distinctions:**
- **WgMMA operations**: Include implicit proxy fences upon completion (e.g., after `wgmma.commit` + `wgmma.wait`, the async and generic proxies are already synced) - see [SyncGuide.md](./SyncGuide.md#wgmma-operations)
- **tcgen05 operations**: Do **NOT** include implicit proxy fences, so `fence.proxy.async` use is up to the user when transitioning between proxy contexts

For complete details on proxy fence semantics, see [SyncGuide.md](./SyncGuide.md#proxy-execution-contexts) and [PTX ISA fence.proxy documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-fence-proxy).

### 10.5. Code Motion Fence Placement
**Question**: Are there specific rules about where `tcgen05.fence::before_thread_sync` and `tcgen05.fence::after_thread_sync` must be placed?
- **Current assumption**: Immediately before/after thread synchronization primitives
- **Needs verification**: Exact placement rules and whether multiple fences are needed

**Answer**: The `tcgen05.fence` instructions are designed to prevent instruction reordering during compilation optimizations. The compilation pipeline transforms PTX to SASS machine code and includes instruction-level parallelism (ILP) optimizations that can reorder instructions to hide latency. The `tcgen05.fence` instructions specifically limit instruction movement with respect to synchronization commands to preserve intended synchronization semantics. They must be placed to prevent `tcgen05` instructions from being reordered **across** synchronization boundaries.

### 10.6. tcgen05.relinquish_alloc_permit Usage
**Question**: What is the purpose and usage pattern of `tcgen05.relinquish_alloc_permit`?
- **Current status**: Listed in control instructions but no usage examples or detailed explanation provided
- **Needs clarification**: When and why this instruction is used, its relationship to `tcgen05.alloc`, and its impact on synchronization dependencies

**Partial Answer**: The `tcgen05.relinquish_alloc_permit` instruction signals that the issuing CTA will not allocate any more tensor memory (TMEM) after that point. This declaration allows the compiler to perform optimizations knowing that no further `tcgen05.alloc` operations will occur in the CTA.

**Still needs clarification**:
- What specific compiler optimizations are enabled by this declaration?
- Are there synchronization implications when some CTAs relinquish permits while others haven't?
- Should this instruction be placed before or after final `tcgen05.dealloc` operations?
- How does this interact with cross-CTA tensor memory sharing scenarios?

### 10.7. Mixed Completion Mechanism Interactions
**Question**: How do operations with different completion mechanisms interact in complex pipelines?
- **Current assumption**: Direct wait and mbarrier completion mechanisms are independent
- **Needs verification**: Can `tcgen05.wait::ld` and `tcgen05.commit` be safely mixed? Are there ordering requirements between different completion mechanisms?

**Answer**: Yes, the different completion mechanisms can be safely mixed in complex pipelines. The ordering between operations follows the dependencies described in the dependency matrix (section 4.1).

**Key Rules:**
- **Automatic pipelining**: When the dependency matrix shows ✅ (pipelined), operations complete in the correct order automatically
- **Manual synchronization**: When the matrix shows ❌ (manual sync), explicit synchronization is required using:
  - `tcgen05.wait::ld` or `tcgen05.wait::st` for load/store completion
  - `tcgen05.commit` + `mbarrier.wait` for mbarrier-based completion
  - Fence operations when transitioning between proxy contexts

**Example of mixed completion mechanisms:**
```cuda
// Load with direct wait completion
tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem_a], [smem_a];
tcgen05.wait::ld.sync.aligned [tmem_a];  // Direct wait completion

// MMA with mbarrier completion
tcgen05.mma.cta_group::1.kind::f16 [acc], [tmem_a], [tmem_b], idesc, 1;
tcgen05.commit.cta_group::1.mbarrier::arrive::one.shared::cta.b64 [mbar];
mbarrier.wait.shared.b64 [mbar], expected_state;  // MBarrier completion

// Store with direct wait completion
tcgen05.st.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [smem_out], [acc];
tcgen05.wait::st.sync.aligned [smem_out];  // Direct wait completion
```

### 10.8. Resource-Specific Pipelining Rules
**Question**: Do pipelining rules differ when operations target the same vs. different tensor memory resources?
- **Current gap**: The dependency matrix doesn't distinguish between same-resource and different-resource operations
- **Needs clarification**: Whether accessing the same tensor memory address affects automatic pipelining behavior

**Partial Answer**: The tensor memory address likely doesn't affect pipelining behavior in the same way that register dependencies do, but this needs verification.

**Key Distinction - Register vs. Tensor Memory Addressing:**
- **Register dependencies**: Register addresses are compile-time constants ("immediate" variables), allowing the compiler to statically analyze dependencies and impose ordering
- **Tensor memory dependencies**: Tensor memory addresses are runtime values, making it harder for the compiler to perform static dependency analysis

**Current Understanding:**
- **Pipelining rules**: Likely independent of specific tensor memory addresses, based on instruction types rather than runtime addresses
- **Dependency analysis**: The dependency matrix probably applies regardless of whether operations target the same or different tensor memory regions
- **Runtime addressing**: Since tmem addresses are computed at runtime (not compile-time constants), the hardware/compiler likely uses instruction-level pipelining rules rather than address-specific analysis

**Still needs verification**:
- Does the hardware track tensor memory address dependencies at runtime?
- Are there any address-based hazard detection mechanisms for tensor memory?
- How does this compare to shared memory address dependency tracking?

### 10.9. CTA Group Size Impact on Synchronization
**Question**: How does the CTA group size (e.g., `cta_group::1` vs `cta_group::4`) affect synchronization requirements?
- **Current assumption**: Synchronization rules are independent of group size
- **Needs verification**: Whether larger CTA groups require additional synchronization or affect pipelining behavior

**Answer**: The CTA group size affects the **scope of synchronization** for `tcgen05.commit` operations, determining which CTAs participate in the mbarrier synchronization.

**Key Behavior:**
- **Group-wide synchronization**: `tcgen05.commit` with `cta_group::4` synchronizes all CTAs in that 4-CTA group
- **Modifier matching**: Only tcgen05 instructions that include the same `cta_group::N` modifier participate in the group synchronization
- **Scoped operations**: The group size determines which CTAs are included in the mbarrier completion mechanism

**Example:**
```cuda
// All 4 CTAs in the group execute these operations
tcgen05.mma.cta_group::4.kind::f16 [acc], [tmem_a], [tmem_b], idesc, 1;

// This commit synchronizes across all 4 CTAs in the group
// Only tcgen05 operations with cta_group::4 are included
tcgen05.commit.cta_group::4.mbarrier::arrive::one.shared::cluster.b64 [mbar];

// All 4 CTAs wait for the group's operations to complete
mbarrier.wait.shared.b64 [mbar], expected_state;
```

**Synchronization Implications:**
- **Coordination requirement**: All CTAs in the group must participate in the commit/wait pattern
- **Resource sharing**: Group operations may share tensor memory or coordination resources
- **Performance impact**: Larger groups may have different completion latencies compared to single-CTA operations

### 10.10. Error Handling and Recovery
**Question**: What happens when tcgen05 operations fail, and how does this affect synchronization?
- **Current gap**: No discussion of error conditions or recovery mechanisms
- **Needs clarification**: How failed operations interact with completion mechanisms, whether partial failures are possible, and recovery strategies

**Answer**: tcgen05 operations follow standard PTX error handling behavior - the kernel will throw an error when operations fail. This is consistent with other PTX instructions and is expected behavior.

**Key Points:**
- **Standard PTX behavior**: Error handling follows the same patterns as other PTX instructions
- **Kernel termination**: Failed operations result in kernel errors/exceptions
- **No special recovery**: tcgen05 doesn't introduce unique error handling mechanisms
- **Synchronization impact**: Since the kernel terminates on error, synchronization state becomes irrelevant

### 10.11. Performance Impact of Fence Placement
**Question**: What is the actual performance cost of tcgen05 fence instructions?
- **Current status**: Section 9.2 was removed due to lack of reliable performance data
- **Needs measurement**: Quantitative analysis of fence overhead in realistic workloads, comparison with and without fences

**Answer**: tcgen05.fence instructions have **no direct performance cost** at runtime, unlike `fence.proxy.async` which corresponds to actual SASS instructions with execution overhead.

**Performance Impact Analysis:**
- **No direct cost**: tcgen05.fence instructions are compile-time directives that don't generate runtime SASS instructions
- **Indirect impact**: Performance effects come from constraining instruction-level parallelism (ILP) optimizations during compilation
- **Comparison with fence.proxy.async**: Unlike proxy fences, tcgen05 fences affect compilation behavior rather than runtime execution

**Indirect Performance Effects:**
- **Reduced ILP optimization**: Limits compiler's ability to reorder instructions for latency hiding
- **Constrained scheduling**: May prevent optimal instruction scheduling around synchronization points
- **Trade-off**: The performance cost of reduced optimization vs. the correctness benefit of proper synchronization

**Measurement Approach:**
Rather than measuring fence "overhead," the relevant metric is comparing:
- **With fences**: Correct synchronization but potentially suboptimal instruction scheduling
- **Without fences**: Better ILP optimization but incorrect/undefined synchronization behavior (not a valid comparison for correctness)

### 10.12. Compatibility with Other Async Operations
**Question**: How do tcgen05 operations interact with other asynchronous operations like cp.async or wgmma?
- **Current assumption**: Operations are independent
- **Needs verification**: Whether tcgen05 operations can be safely interleaved with cp.async.bulk, wgmma, or other async instructions, and what synchronization is required

**Answer**: Yes, tcgen05 operations are independent and can be safely interleaved with other asynchronous operations like `cp.async.bulk`, `wgmma`, and other async instructions.

**Key Principles:**
- **Independent execution**: tcgen05 operations don't interfere with other async operation types
- **Safe interleaving**: Can mix tcgen05, cp.async, wgmma, and other async operations in the same kernel
- **Standard synchronization rules**: When dependencies exist between different operation types, use appropriate synchronization mechanisms

**Synchronization Requirements When Dependencies Exist:**
- **Execution synchronization**: Use completion mechanisms (`tcgen05.wait`, `tcgen05.commit`/`mbarrier.wait`, `cp.async.wait`, `wgmma.wait`, etc.)
- **Code motion fences**: Use `tcgen05.fence::*` to prevent reordering across thread synchronization points
- **Memory fences**: Use `fence.proxy.async` when transitioning between proxy execution contexts

**Example of Mixed Async Operations:**
```cuda
// Traditional async copy
cp.async.bulk.shared::cluster.global.mbarrier::complete_tx::bytes [smem_a], [gmem_a], size, [mbar1];

// tcgen05 operations
tcgen05.alloc.cta_group::1.sync.aligned.shared::cta.b32 [tmem], 1024;
tcgen05.ld.sync.aligned.32x32b.x1.b32 [tmem], [smem_b];

// wgmma operation
wgmma.mma_async.sync.aligned.m16n8k32.f16.f16.f16.f16 [acc], [smem_c], [smem_d];

// Synchronize all operations as needed
cp.async.wait_all 0;                                    // Wait for cp.async
tcgen05.wait::ld.sync.aligned [tmem];                   // Wait for tcgen05.ld
wgmma.commit_group.sync.aligned;                        // Commit wgmma
wgmma.wait_group.sync.aligned 0;                        // Wait for wgmma

// Now safe to use all results together
```

### 10.13. Tensor Memory Address Syntax and Addressing
**Question**: What are the exact syntax rules and addressing constraints for tensor memory operands in tcgen05 instructions?
- **Current gap**: Examples show `[tmem]`, `[tmem+512]`, `[tmem+1024]` but addressing rules are unclear
- **Needs clarification**:
  - Are tensor memory addresses always bracket-enclosed like `[tmem]`?
  - What addressing modes are supported (immediate offsets, register offsets, etc.)?
  - Are there alignment requirements for tensor memory addresses?
  - How do address calculations work with different CTA group sizes?

### 10.14. Instruction Parameter Consistency
**Question**: Are there naming and parameter conventions that should be consistently followed across examples?
- **Current inconsistencies observed**:
  - `idesc` vs other descriptor naming
  - `enable` parameter usage varies
  - `size` vs explicit byte counts
  - `expected_state` vs other mbarrier state names
- **Needs clarification**: Standard parameter naming conventions for tcgen05 instructions

### 10.15. Scope and Lifetime of Tensor Memory Allocations
**Question**: What are the scope and lifetime rules for tensor memory allocated with different CTA group sizes?
- **Current gap**: No clear explanation of when tensor memory becomes unavailable
- **Needs clarification**:
  - Does tensor memory persist across kernel boundaries?
  - How does tensor memory interact with CTA scheduling and termination?
  - Can tensor memory be shared between different CTA groups?
  - What happens to tensor memory if a CTA terminates early due to divergent control flow?

### 10.16. tcgen05.shift Completion Mechanism and Usage
**Question**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Based on PTX ISA documentation analysis
- **Answer**: `tcgen05.shift` uses **mbarrier completion** (`tcgen05.commit`) like other async operations (`cp`, `mma`)
- **Execution context**: Async Proxy (confirmed by [PTX ISA Section 9.7.16.6.4](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-memory-consistency-model-mbarrier-completion))
- **Pipelining**: Updated in dependency matrix with relationships similar to other async operations
- **nvFuser context**: Since nvFuser doesn't plan to use `tcgen05.shift` extensively, detailed usage patterns are not prioritized, but the instruction is now properly documented for completeness
