# Introduction

Indivisible splits has many interesting properties that deserve us thinking.

Let's begin the discussion with a simple question:

If I have a tensor `T0[I1, I2]`, are the following two schedules equivalent?

- **Schedule 1:** `[I1, I2] -- split -> [I1, I2/4, 4] -- merge -> [I1*(I2/4), 4]`.
- **Schedule 2:** `[I1, I2] -- merge -> [I1*I2] -- split -> [(I1*I2)/4, 4]`.

Where the divisions above are all ceildiv.

If the split is indivisible, the answer is no.
We can see this from a simple example where `I1` has extent `2`, and `I2` has extent `5`.

For schedule 1, after schedule, the extents of the leaf domain will be `[2*2, 4]`.
So for this schedule, we will be iterating the tensor as:

```python
T[0, 0], T[0, 1], T[0, 2] , T[0, 3]
T[0, 4], T[0, 5], T[0, 6] , T[0, 7]
T[1, 0], T[1, 1], T[1, 2] , T[1, 3]
T[1, 4], T[1, 5], T[1, 6] , T[1, 7]
```

For schedule 2, after schedule, the extents of the leaf domain will be `[3, 4]`.
So for this schedule, we will be iterating the tensor as:

```python
T[0, 0], T[0, 1], T[0, 2] , T[0, 3]
T[0, 4], T[1, 0], T[1, 1] , T[1, 2]
T[1, 3], T[1, 4], T[2, 0] , T[2, 1]
```

They are clearly not equivalent.

What if the split is divisible? They are equivalent!

# Implications

## Merging discontiguous IterDomains

- Q1: Can I merge two discontiguous IterDomains to create a larger IterDomain, and split out a vectorization IterDomain from this larger IterDomain?
- Q2: In TMA scheduling, can I create the TMA domain by merging two discontiguous IterDomains, and then split out a box?

The answer is: yes if and only if the split size divide the extent of the inner IterDomain of the merge.
If we merge discontiguous IterDomains then do a split that does not divide the inner extent,
we will end up iterating the tensor like schedule 2.
From the above listing, we see that after `T[0, 4]`, we should be accessing `T[1, 0]`,
which is not contiguous to `T[0, 4]` in memory.
However, vectorization and TMA can only access memory contiguously.
