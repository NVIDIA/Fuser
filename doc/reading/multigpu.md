# Multi-GPU Support in nvFuser

## Introduction

A key strength of nvFuser has been its ability to automatically optimize CUDA
kernels by parallelizing them across threads and blocks. This is achieved by
cleanly separating the *definition* of what to compute from the *schedule* that
determines how to execute it efficiently.

We believe this principle extends naturally from single-GPU to multi-GPU
workloads. For instance, online softmax has been the core idea behind
FlashAttention for single-GPU and context parallelism for multi-GPU. Programmers
also strive to overlap communication and GEMMs, much like overlaping TMA
loads/stores with tensor-core operations.

Therefore, since 2024, we have been generalizing these representations and
algorithms -- originally built for single-GPU execution -- to enable efficient
parallelization of deep learning workloads across multiple GPUs.

## User API

The following example demonstrates how to run a distributed GPT-3 style MLP
block using nvFuser's multi-GPU API.

```python
def define_fusion(fd: FusionDefinition):
    inp = fd.define_tensor([-1, h])  # [batch * sequence, hidden]
    up_w = fd.define_tensor([h * 4, h])
    out = fd.ops.linear(inp, up_w)

    # `gelu` runs a series of pointwise operations. For simplicity, I omit the
    # details and treat it as one pointwise operation.
    out = gelu(out)

    down_w = fd.define_tensor([h, h * 4])
    out = fd.ops.linear(out, down_w)

    fd.add_output(out)

inp_dtensors: list[DTensor]
fdw = FusionDefinitionWrapper(define_fusion)
out_dtensors: list[DTensor] = fdw(inp_dtensors)
```

A user initializes a
[`FusionDefinitionWrapper`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Fuser/blob/84c46fed9256b94c4eb9c7aa7f5757056dc88783/tests/python/multidevice/fusion_definition_wrapper.py#L21)
with a **single-GPU** fusion definition. Then, they can invoke it with a list
of three
[`DTensor`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.tensor.html#dtensor-class-apis)
objects -- corresponding to the input activations, the up-projection weights,
and the down-projection weights. The result is a list containing a single
`DTensor` that represents the output activations of the MLP block.

Under the hood, nvFuser derives a **multi-GPU** schedule from the definition and
the input `DTensor`s, then executes that schedule across multiple GPUs. This
automatically handles sharding and communication and therefore removes the need
for users to explicitly orchestrate communications such as
`torch.distributed.all_reduce`.

By default, nvFuser strives to generate an efficient schedule automatically.
For performance-critical workloads, however, users can extend `define_fusion`
with schedules that nvFuser must honor. These are specified through the
scheduling Python API, using primitives such as `TensorView.split` and
`IterDomain.parallelize`.

## Parallelisms

This section walks through several common forms of parallelism and shows how
they can be represented and implemented in fusion IR. For simplicity, I'll use
the above MLP block as the running example. These parallelisms also apply to
other parts of a Transformer, such as MHA, RMSNorm and embedding layers. For
clarity, I'll only cover forward propagation -- backpropagation typically shards
tensors in the same way.

### Tensor Parallelism (TP)

To apply [TP](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/nemotoolkit/features/parallelisms.html#tensor-parallelism),
the user calls the `FusionDefinitionWrapper` with the following `DTensor`s:
* `inp` with placement `Replicated()`
* `up_w` with placement `Shard(0)`
* `down_w` with placement `Shard(1)`

Therefore, nvFuser starts with the following fusion IR:

```
 inp: [t, h]                          up_w: [4h,  h]
                                             /\
                                            d
                        |
                        | linear
                        |
                     [t, 4h, r{h}]
                        |
                        | gelu
                        |
                     [t, 4h]                down_w: [h, 4h]
                                                        /\
                                                       d
                                       |
                                       | linear
                                       |
                                  [t, h, r{4h}]
```

#### Sharding Propagation

nvFuser propagates shardings from inputs to outputs:

```
 in: [t, h]                           up_w: [4h,  h]
                                             /\
                                            d
                        |
                        | linear
                        |
                     [t, 4h, r{h}]
                         /\
                        d
                        |
                        | gelu
                        |
                     [t, 4h]                down_w: [h, 4h]
                         /\                             /\
                        d                              d
                                       |
                                       | linear
                                       |
                                  [t, h, r{4h}]
                                           /\
                                        r{d}
```

#### Communication-computation Decomposition

After sharding propagation, nvFuser decomposes every Expr that performs both
communication and computation, because they are initiated by different runtime
APIs.  In the above fusion IR, the second `linear` performs both intra-GPU GEMM
and inter-GPU reduction. After decomposition, the fusion IR becomes:

```
 in: [t, h]                           up_w: [4h,  h]
                                             /\
                                            d
                        |
                        | linear
                        |
                     [t, 4h, r{h}]
                         /\
                        d
                        |
                        | gelu
                        |
                     [t, 4h]                down_w: [h, 4h]
                         /\                             /\
                        d                              d
                                       |
                                       | linear
                                       |
                               [t, h, d, r{4h/d}]
                                       |
                                       | sum
                                       |
                                  [t, h, r{d}]
```

This fusion IR then goes through segmentation, (intra-GPU) scheduling, device
lowering, and host IR lowering. Eventually, the `linear`s and the `gelu` become
CUDA kernels and the `sum` becomes a call to `ncclAllReduce`.

### Sequence Parallelism (SP)

[SP](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/nemotoolkit/features/parallelisms.html#sequence-parallelism)
extends TP by sharding not just the parameters but also input and
output activations. This comes with the following benefits:
* The program uses less memory for activations.
* The surrounding operations like LayerNorm and Dropout run faster.
* This creates more opportunities for communication-computation overlapping.

However, it tends to increase latency so it's not applied universally.

To apply SP, the user calls the `FusionDefinitionWrapper` with the following `DTensor`s:
* `inp` with placement `Shard(0)`
* `up_w` with placement `Shard(0)`
* `down_w` with placement `Shard(1)`

As a result, nvFuser starts with the following fusion IR:

```
 inp: [t, h]                          up_w: [4h,  h]
      / \                                    /\
     d                                      d
                        |
                        | linear
                        |
                     [t, 4h, r{h}]
                        |
                        | gelu
                        |
                     [t, 4h]                down_w: [h, 4h]
                                                        /\
                                                       d
                                       |
                                       | linear
                                       |
                                  [t, h, r{4h}]
```

#### Sharding Propagation

```
 inp: [t, h]                          up_w: [4h,  h]
      / \                                    /\
     d                                      d
                        |
                        | linear
                        |
                     [t, 4h, r{h}]
                         /\
                        d
                        |
                        | gelu
                        |
                     [t, 4h]                down_w: [h, 4h]
                         /\                             /\
                        d                              d
                                       |
                                       | linear
                                       |
                                  [t, h, r{4h}]
                                  / \      /\
                                 d      r{d}
```

When nvFuser propagates shardings through the first `linear`, it can choose to
either follow `inp`'s sharding and split `t` by `d` or follow `up_w` and split
`4h` by `d`. Currently, our implementation chooses to follow `up_w` so weights
(usually larger than activations) don't have to be redistributed.

The output's `t` is split by `d`. nvFuser wouldn't do this automatically if it
runs the MLP block alone. However, in practice, the MLP block is followed by a
residual connection. Therefore, `t` being split by `d` can be forward
propagated through that residual connection and then back propagated through
the addition.

#### Communication-computation Decomposition

Two `Expr`s in the above figure perform both communication and computation:
1. The first `linear` redistributes `inp` and runs a GEMM.
2. The second `linear` runs a GEMM and redistributes the output.

After decomposition, the fusion IR becomes:

```
 inp: [t, h]
      / \
     d
     |
     | set
     |
      [t, h]                          up_w: [4h,  h]
                                             /\
                                            d
                        |
                        | linear
                        |
                     [t, 4h, r{h}]
                         /\
                        d
                        |
                        | gelu
                        |
                     [t, 4h]                down_w: [h, 4h]
                         /\                             /\
                        d                              d
`                                      |
                                       | linear
                                       |
                               [t, h, d, r{4h/d}]
                                       |
                                       | sum
                                       |
                                  [t, h, r{d}]
                                  / \
                                 d
```

This fusion IR then goes through the rest of the nvFuser stack. The `set`
becomes a call to `ncclAllGather` and the `sum` becomes a call to
`ncclReduceScatter`.

### Overlap Communication with GEMM via Decomposition

[This technique](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3567955.3567959) is orthogonal
and can be applied to different types of parallelism (e.g., sequence, tensor,
and context parallelism) to cut down latency. Instead of running communication
operations (e.g., Allgather, ReduceScatter) and computation operations (e.g.,
GEMM) one after another, it breaks them into smaller pieces and overlaps
communication with computation to reduce wall time.

<img src="multigpu/allgather_matmul_overlap.png" alt="Figure 1" width="600">

> **Figure 1.** Overlap allgather with GEMM[^1]

[^1]: Wang et al., *Overlap Communication with Dependent Computation via
    Decomposition in Large Deep Learning Models*, ASPLOS 2023.
https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3567955.3567959

There are two types of decomposition:
* Collective-based. A large communication collective is decomposed into collectives of the same nature.
* Ring-based. A large communication collective is decomposed into circular-shift point-to-point communications.

The tradeoffs are:
* Collective-based exposes a fine-grained communication to the critical path.
* Collective-based is easier to implement in nvFuser because it doesn't involve circular shift.
* Ring-based decomposition requires the number of chunks to be a multiple of the number of devices, whereas collective-based decomposition doesn't.
* Ring-based decomposition supports canonical layouts better.

[This
test](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Fuser/blob/main/tests/cpp/test_overlap.cpp#L57)
shows how the fusion IR represents a decomposed allgather with GEMM using
ring-based scheme. This decomposition allows host IR optimizations to assign
different loop iterations to different CUDA streams, enabling overlapping.

### Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP)

[DDP](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/nemotoolkit/features/parallelisms.html#distributed-data-parallelism)
shards activations not parameters.

```
 in: [t, h]                           up_w: [4h,  h]
     / \
    d
                        |
                        | linear
                        |
                     [t, 4h, r{h}]
                     /\
                    d
                        |
                        | gelu
                        |
                     [t, 4h]                down_w: [h, 4h]
                     /\
                    d
                                       |
                                       | linear
                                       |
                                 [t, h, r{4h}]
                                 / \
                                d
```

nvFuser adopts the
[DeviceMesh](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/distributed_device_mesh.html)
concept from XLA and PyTorch.

So far, I've assumed a one-dimensional `DeviceMesh`. In practice, users
often want to combine multiple forms of parallelism, which leads to
multi-dimensional `DeviceMesh`es.

For example, consider 1,024 GPUs distributed across 128 nodes with 8 GPUs per
node.  Suppose the user wants to apply DDP across nodes and TP within each node.
They can define a two-dimensional `DeviceMesh` of shape `[128, 8]`, using
`deviceIdx.y` (size 128) to shard across nodes and `deviceIdx.x` (size 8) to
shard across GPUs within a node.

In this setup, the fusion IR just before segmentation becomes:

```
 in: [t, h]                           up_w: [4h,  h]

### Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP)

[FSDP](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_tutorial.html)
shards both activations and parameters. Before forward and backward, sharded
parameters are all-gathered into unsharded parameters.

For simplicity, I'll skip sharding propagation and decomposition, and present the
fusion IR just before segmentation:

```
                                      up_w: [4h,  h]
                                             /\
                                            d
                                            |
                                            | set
                                            |
 in: [t, h]                                 [4h,  h]
     / \
    d
                        |
                        | linear
                        |
                     [t, 4h, r{h}]          down_w: [h, 4h]
                     /\                                 /\
                    d                                  d
                        |                             |
                        | gelu                        | set
                        |                             |
                     [t, 4h]                        [h, 4h]
                     /\
                    d
                                       |
                                       | linear
                                       |
                                 [t, h, r{4h}]
                                 / \
                                d
```

The two `set`s become calls to `ncclAllGather`. During host IR optimization,
nvFuser will (a) deallocate all-gathered parameters right after they are used, and
(b) assign the two allgathers to a different CUDA stream so they can be
overlapped with computation.
