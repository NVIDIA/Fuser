# TMA Modeling In Depth

This document means to provide a deeper insight into how we model TMA, primarily at IterDomain level.
This document is not an introduction to our TMA support, which can be found [here](../dev/tma.md).
This document does not discuss topics like hardware, performance, computer architecture, etc.,
instead, we focus on mathematical correctness of our modeling here.
This document assumes knowledge on the [introduction doc](../dev/tma.md).

We will focus on tiled TMA here, im2col TMA is not supported yet.

## What is TMA?

## Correctness model
