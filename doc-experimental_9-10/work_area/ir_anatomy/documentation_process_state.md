Process Reference: Documentation Development Process (org-guidelines/Development_Approach/Documentation_Development_Process.md)
Last Updated: 2025-09-10

## Current Project Context
- Documentation Project: Fusion IR anatomy and printer semantics
- Project Goal: Explain IR print format: symbols, memory spaces, Set vs Set.Permute, labeling
- Target Audience: Developers reading IR dumps for debugging/scheduling
- SME Identified: Requestor (project owner)

## Stage Progress
- Current Stage: Stage 1: Research and Information Gathering
- Stage Status: In Progress
- Current Deliverable Focus: Article with annotated dump and code cites
- Stage Completion Criteria: Gather guide/sample and key source cites

## Process State
- SME Consultation Status: Not needed yet
- Validation Checkpoint Status: Pending
- Fresh Perspective Review Status: Planned later
- Technical Documentation Best Practices Application: Progressive detail; annotated examples; precise terminology

## Immediate Actions
- Next Action Required: Draft article with annotated dump and references
- Approval Needed: None
- Dependencies: ../../doc-bot/experimenting/8-26-2025/Fusion_IR_Anatomy.md, ../../doc-bot/experimenting/8-26-2025/tv_deeper_dive.cpp
