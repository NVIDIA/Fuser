# Documentation Process State

**Process Reference:** Documentation Development Process (org-guidelines/Development_Approach/Documentation_Development_Process.md)
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-10

## Current Project Context
- **Documentation Project:** Building and running standalone nvFuser samples
- **Project Goal:** Provide reliable build and run instructions with scripts, manual commands, and troubleshooting
- **Target Audience:** Developers building small nvFuser C++ samples outside PyTorch
- **SME Identified:** Requestor (project owner)

## Stage Progress
- **Current Stage:** Stage 1: Research and Information Gathering
- **Stage Status:** In Progress
- **Current Deliverable Focus:** Article with commands, helper scripts, and troubleshooting
- **Stage Completion Criteria:** Scripts and logs referenced; instructions validated; troubleshooting captured

## Process State
- **SME Consultation Status:** Not needed for basic flow; available for environment specifics
- **Validation Checkpoint Status:** Pending
- **Fresh Perspective Review Status:** Planned after next topic batch
- **Technical Documentation Best Practices Application:** Progressive detail; actionable commands; implicit knowledge (LD_LIBRARY_PATH, driver/IR-only)

## Immediate Actions
- **Next Action Required:** Draft article and cite scripts; capture workarounds
- **Approval Needed:** Optional confirmation on environment specifics (driver/toolchain)
- **Dependencies:** None
